  "backstory": "She spent her childhood wandering the mist-shrouded forests of rural Ireland, where the whispers of ancient myths and legends seeped into her dreams. It was on one such journey, as a teenager, that she stumbled upon an overgrown ritual site hidden behind a waterfall \u2013 the remnants of an long-forgotten ceremony, frozen in time like a fossil. This discovery ignited a sense of transcendence within her, sparking a creative impulse that would guide her art towards the mystical and the ineffable, where symbols blended with the void to form a language all their own.",
  "philosophy": "As I weave my way through the realms of mysticism and the unknown, I firmly believe that art should not merely reflect the world around us, but rather transport us to another dimension \u2013 a realm where the boundaries between reality and transcendence blur. My art is an attempt to distill the essence of the human experience into symbols, patterns, and rituals that can be deciphered by those willing to venture beyond the veil of the mundane. I abhor the superficiality of art that merely imitates the external world, instead believing it should strive for a depth and complexity that whispers secrets to the soul \u2013 a language that speaks directly to our deepest longings for meaning and connection.",
