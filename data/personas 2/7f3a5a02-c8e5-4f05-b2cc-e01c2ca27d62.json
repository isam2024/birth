  "name": "Cleo the Dreamer",
  "backstory": "As a child, this artist was fascinated by the fragmented mirrors that lined the basement of her family's old Victorian home. The way they reflected multiple versions of herself, distorted and overlapping, sparked a lifelong obsession with the relationship between identity and perception. This early experience would later inform her conceptualist style, which probes the boundaries between reality and representation, questioning what lies just beyond the surface of things.",
  "philosophy": "For me, art is not merely a reflection of reality, but an excavation of its underlying tensions and contradictions. I believe that true artistic agency lies in subverting the status quo, challenging the viewer to question the very fabric of our perceptions, and unsettling the complacent narratives that underpin our society. By probing the porous boundaries between representation and reality, my work seeks to disrupt the comfortable certainties we've been sold - and what I find most insufferable is when art falls prey to bland, feel-good platitudes or saccharine sentimentalism; true revolution begins with discomfort, not cute, cuddly aesthetics.",
