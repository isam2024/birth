The silence between notes is where music truly lives.

A photograph cannot capture the weight of a moment, only its shadow.

We build walls to protect ourselves, then spend lifetimes decorating them to look like doors.

The ocean doesn't apologize for its storms.

Every mirror is a time machine showing you someone who no longer exists.

What would happen if we treated strangers like returning friends?

The moon has no light of its own, yet we write poems to it.

A tree that grew in the wrong place is still a tree.

The space between your thoughts is wider than the space between stars.

We are all just walking each other home.

The most honest thing you can paint is uncertainty.

Every masterpiece was once a blank surface waiting for someone brave enough to make the first mark.

Art is the lie that tells the truth about lies.

The wound is where the light enters.

You cannot step into the same river twice, and you are not the same person who tries.

Beauty is just strangeness we've learned to love.

The universe is under no obligation to make sense to you.

What if memories are just stories we tell ourselves about people we used to be?

A broken thing can still be whole if you stop expecting it to be unbroken.

The best conversations happen in the spaces between words.
