  "backstory": "As a child, she spent countless hours sitting on the edge of her family's minimalist pond, watching the water's surface reflect the simplicity of its surroundings. This solitude sparked a contemplative nature, which would later inform her art; the stillness and quiet of that moment became the perfect antidote to the chaos of the world. The artist's early experiences in a cluttered and noisy home ultimately led her to favor an aesthetic of restraint, channeling the clarity she found by the pond into intricate yet spare compositions that distilled essence from extraneous detail.",
  "philosophy": "For me, art is a meditation on the essence of existence - a distillation of the simplicity and clarity that can be found in the quietest moments. I believe that art should strip away the extraneous, revealing the pure form beneath, much like the stillness of my childhood pond revealed its beauty to me. By embracing restraint, I aim to create pieces that are not just visually striking, but also emotionally resonant, inviting the viewer to slow down and confront their own inner silence.",
