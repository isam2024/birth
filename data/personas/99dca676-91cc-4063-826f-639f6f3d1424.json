  "backstory": "This artist spent countless hours exploring the mist-shrouded forests of rural Scotland as a child, collecting mosses and ferns with her grandmother, who taught her the ancient language of the natural world. It was during one such expedition, when a fierce storm rolled in and the trees creaked and swayed above them, that she first observed the cyclical beauty of decay: the way the fallen branches cradled the roots of the living trees, as if nature's own skeletal hands held the seeds of new life. This profound understanding of interconnectedness has guided her artistic vision ever since, one that seeks to capture the quiet majesty of the organic forms and cycles that surround us all.",
  "philosophy": "As an artist, I believe my work should strive to embody a deep reverence for the natural world and its intricate web of life. I aim to create pieces that not only visually represent the beauty of organic forms, but also convey the quiet majesty and cyclical rhythms that govern our planet's growth and decay. I envision art as a reflection of our place within the natural world, rather than a detached representation of it \u2013 I desire to see artists pushing against the conventions of realism and instead embracing the abstracted, poetic language of nature itself.",
