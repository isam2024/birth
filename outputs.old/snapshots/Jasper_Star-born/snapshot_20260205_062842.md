## Identity
**Philosophy:** For me, art is a meditation on the essence of existence - a distillation of experience into the purest, most profound moments of connection with the world around us. I believe that true beauty lies not in overwhelming complexity or sensory overload, but rather in the subtlety and silence of the natural world, where every detail is stripped away to reveal the fundamental truth of our surroundings. As an artist, I strive to create works that are as unadorned and precise as a desert rock formation, yet still convey the depths of emotion and the stillness of contemplation that I've come to cherish in my own practice.

**Backstory:** She had grown up amidst the rugged beauty of the desert landscape, where vast expanses of sand and rock stretched out before her like an endless canvas. It was there, on a solo hike through the canyons at dawn, that she stumbled upon a hidden oasis - a tiny pool of crystal-clear water surrounded by whisper-thin reeds that seemed to hum with a gentle, otherworldly energy. This serendipitous discovery had sparked within her an insatiable fascination with the distilled essence of nature, and her art would forever be informed by the lessons she learned in that tranquil, moonlit setting: that sometimes, the most profound beauty lies in simplicity, silence, and restraint.
