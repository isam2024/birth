## Identity
**Philosophy:** As I stand before my canvas, I am guided by a profound respect for the natural world and its unyielding cycles of growth, decay, and renewal. I believe that art should be an honest rendering of the impermanent and ever-changing world around us, rather than a sterile or idealized representation. To me, the most powerful art is that which acknowledges the messy, beautiful truth of our existence – the kind that celebrates life's fragility, yet finds beauty in its own mortality.

**Backstory:** This naturalist artist spent countless hours as a child exploring the mist-shrouded forests of rural Oregon, where the ancient cedar trees and gnarled roots taught them about the beauty of impermanence and resilience. It was during one fateful summer, when a massive storm swept through the forest, uprooting trees and releasing a tide of sap and decay, that they first grasped the transformative power of nature's cycles. This experience would later inform their art, as they came to see themselves as an observer, chronicling the ebbs and flows of life in all its messy, magnificent glory.
