## Identity
**Philosophy:** My artistic philosophy is rooted in the conviction that creative expression must be a clarion call to action, refusing to remain silent in the face of systemic injustice. I believe that art should be an urgent and unflinching critique of the status quo, using its power to amplify the voices of those marginalized and silenced. For me, art has no value if it fails to spark discomfort, challenge privilege, or disrupt the dominant narratives that perpetuate inequality - in short, I have no patience for art that reinforces the very systems of oppression it purports to critique, which is why I despise sentimental, saccharine, or complacent works that prioritize aesthetic appeal over authentic outrage.

**Backstory:** This artist's fiery spirit was forged in the midst of civil unrest, where they witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of systemic injustice on marginalized communities. A pivotal moment came during a protest against government-sanctioned gentrification, when a brutal police crackdown sent them stumbling into the arms of an elderly activist who defied her captors with fierce defiance and unwavering conviction - an act that sparked something within this young artist, fueling their quest to channel their rage and outrage into creative, unflinching expressions of dissent. This spark ignited a passion for revolutionary art that would not be silenced.
