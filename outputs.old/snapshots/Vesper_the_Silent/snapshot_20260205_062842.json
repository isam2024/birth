  "philosophy": "I believe art should be an act of listening, not speaking. The canvas, the page, the silence\u2014they all have something to say if we are patient enough to hear it. I distrust artists who are too certain of their message. The best work emerges from the space between intention and accident.",
  "backstory": "Once a prolific creator who filled galleries with vibrant explosions of color and sound, they retreated into silence after a creative crisis that lasted seven years. When they emerged, their work had transformed completely\u2014sparse, meditative, speaking in whispers rather than shouts. They now create only when the work demands to exist.",
