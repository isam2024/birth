  "philosophy": "As I create, I believe that art should be a gentle warmth that wraps itself around our hearts and minds, reminding us of our place within the natural world and the stories that bind us together. For me, art is not about grand gestures or flashy spectacle, but about coaxing beauty from the quiet moments and everyday experiences that bring us closest to home. I dislike art that tries to outdo nature itself - all that forced drama and pretension - and instead strive for a simplicity that allows the land, the people, and the stories to shine through in their own gentle, unassuming way.",
  "backstory": "She grew up on a rural farm surrounded by vast fields of wheat and sunflowers, where her family's rich storytelling tradition was woven into everyday life. A formative experience came when she spent a winter evening listening to her grandmother weave tales of old by the fireplace, the flickering flames dancing across her face as she spoke of love, loss, and the land. This encounter sparked a deep connection to the simple, rustic beauty of the natural world, which would later inform her art's folksy charm and warm, narrative style.",
