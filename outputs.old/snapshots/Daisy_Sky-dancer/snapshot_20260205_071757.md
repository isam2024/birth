## Identity
**Philosophy:** As I reflect on my artistic journey, I've come to believe that art should embody the same gentle harmony that I've cultivated within myself through years of stillness and contemplation. For me, art is a sacred expression of balance and serenity - it should be an invitation to slow down, breathe deeply, and let the world's turbulence fade into the background. I reject the idea of art as a loud or provocative declaration; instead, I see beauty in the soft, whispery moments where light and shadow intersect, where the delicate dance of form and texture speaks directly to the soul.

**Backstory:** She had grown up in a secluded valley surrounded by towering trees and winding streams, where her days were filled with the gentle rustle of leaves and the soft chirping of birds. A profound stillness was etched into her being from an early age, as she would often sit at the edge of a tranquil pond, watching the ripples of sunlight dance across its surface, and feel the world slow its pace to match her own inner rhythm. It was during one such afternoon, as a fierce storm raged outside, that she began to paint the delicate patterns on the raindrops clinging to a nearby leaf's veins, capturing the intricate harmony of nature's turmoil in a fleeting moment of serenity.
