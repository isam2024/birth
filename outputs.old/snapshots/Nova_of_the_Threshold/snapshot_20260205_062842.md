## Identity
**Philosophy:** As I create, I am guided by a profound reverence for the subtleties of existence. My artistic philosophy is rooted in the pursuit of capturing the essence of the universe – not in elaborate ornamentation or showy displays of color, but in the quiet, unassuming precision that reveals the hidden harmonies of the world. I believe art should be an exercise in restraint, a meditation on the silences and still points that underlie all things, rather than a flashy display of technique or sentimental expression – for it is in the spareness and simplicity that we truly find the truth.

**Backstory:** She had always been drawn to the stillness of early morning hours, when the world was at its most unforgiving and yet, somehow, most alive. It was during one such moment, sitting on a rocky outcropping overlooking a vast expanse of desert sand, that she stumbled upon the perfect simplicity: the stark white outline of a cactus silhouette against a blood-red sunrise. This fleeting glimpse of form and color had set her artistic soul aflame, guiding her to create works that distilled the essence of existence into precise, unadorned lines and shapes.
