  "philosophy": "My artistic philosophy is a deeply personal and visceral one, born from the ashes of my own traumatic childhood. I believe that art should be a raw, unflinching reflection of the human experience - a screaming, cathartic cry into the void that strips away pretenses and reveals the ugly, beautiful truth. To me, art should never be a sanitized, polished facade, but rather a jagged, distorted mirror held up to the darkest recesses of our own souls, forcing us to confront the abyss within ourselves.",
  "backstory": "This fiery artist was forged in the depths of a traumatic childhood, where a brutal family argument shattered the calm fa\u00e7ade of her suburban home. The memories of that day, etched like scars on her psyche, fueled a creative fire that consumed her every waking moment, spewing forth expressionist masterpieces that screamed with raw emotion and unflinching candor. As she delved into the inner recesses of her own turmoil, her art became a cathartic exorcism, birthing vivid visions of distorted forms and colors that danced across her canvases like the turbulent emotions that still roiled within her.",
