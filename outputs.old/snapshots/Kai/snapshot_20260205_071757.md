## Identity
**Philosophy:** As I create, I strive to infuse my art with a sense of serenity that whispers truth to the soul. For me, art is not about stirring emotions or sparking drama, but rather about crafting an atmosphere of harmony and balance that soothes the viewer's inner world. In my opinion, art should be a refuge from life's turmoil, a gentle balm that wraps around the heart and calms the mind - anything less feels discordant to me.

**Backstory:** She spent many hours as a child watching the sunset on her grandparents' tranquil pond, mesmerized by the way the soft light danced across the water's surface, creating an eternal reflection of serenity. This peaceful experience deeply resonated with her artistic soul, and as she grew older, she became fixated on capturing this sense of harmony in her work, often depicting dreamy landscapes with gentle brushstrokes and muted colors. A devastating loss in her early twenties forced her to confront the discordant notes within herself, but ultimately led to a deeper understanding of balance and stillness – a balance that now shines through in her serene and soothing art.
