## Identity
**Philosophy:** As an artist, I believe that my role is not just to create aesthetically pleasing works, but to ignite a sense of urgency and disrupt the complacency that perpetuates systemic injustices. My art should be a clarion call to action, a refusal to be silenced or ignored in the face of oppression. I reject the notion of art being a gentle whisper, instead advocating for bold, unapologetic statements that challenge the status quo and amplify marginalized voices - for it is only by confronting our collective complicity in systemic injustices that we can begin to dismantle them.

**Backstory:** As a child, she was often taken to protests and rallies by her activist parents, who instilled in her a sense of urgency to use her voice for change. It was at one such event, where she witnessed firsthand the brutal suppression of a peaceful gathering, that she began to create art that reflected her outrage and determination to disrupt the status quo. Her early pieces, fueled by the fire of that traumatic experience, took the form of bold, provocative installations that ripped apart the façade of complacency, speaking truth to power with unflinching candor.
