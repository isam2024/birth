  "philosophy": "As an artist, I believe that my role is not just to create aesthetically pleasing works, but to ignite a sense of urgency and disrupt the complacency that perpetuates systemic injustices.

  "backstory": "As a child, she was often taken to protests and rallies by her activist parents, who instilled in her a sense of urgency to use her voice for change.
