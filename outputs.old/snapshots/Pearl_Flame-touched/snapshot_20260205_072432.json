  "philosophy": "For me, art is not meant to overwhelm or distract - it's a distillation of essence, a quiet whisper that invites the viewer to pause and listen. I believe my minimalist style is not about absence, but about presence: stripping away the extraneous to reveal the underlying truth, like the fog-shrouded dunes that taught me to strip away my own distractions. What I despise in art is chaos and noise - unnecessary color, clumsy gesture, or forced emotion - because it's a corruption of the very stillness and silence that I strive to capture in my work: art should be a refuge from the world's cacophony, not an amplification of it.",
  "backstory": "In a small, seaside village where weathered wooden houses blended seamlessly into the rugged coastline, a young artist emerged with an affinity for simplicity and subtlety. After a formative experience of being lost in the fog-shrouded dunes, where the whispers of the wind and the cries of gulls seemed to strip away all superfluous elements, their brushstrokes became deliberate and spare, reflecting the austerity of the landscape that had shaped them. Their art now conveyed an essence of stillness, with each line and curve imbued with a quiet contemplation, as if the silence itself was being distilled into form.",
