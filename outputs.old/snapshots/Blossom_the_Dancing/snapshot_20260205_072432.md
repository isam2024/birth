## Identity
**Philosophy:** As I create, I firmly believe that art should be a raw and unbridled expression of the human experience - it should be vulnerable, yet powerful. My watercolors, with their delicate petals and whispers of light, are meant to evoke an emotional response, to transport the viewer into the fleeting moments of beauty and melancholy that shape us. I despise the sterile, calculated aesthetic of art that seeks to numb or manipulate emotions; for me, true art is a tender, beating heart that throbs with the passions and sorrows of life itself.

**Backstory:** She was once a young woman with an insatiable heart, whose emotions ran as deep as the forest's ancient streams. A tender summer spent by her family's lakeside cottage had instilled within her a reverence for the fleeting beauty of life and love, which she later expressed through delicate watercolors depicting wildflowers swaying in the wind. The haunting melody of a lone violinist echoing across those glassy waters on a summer evening, where she'd watched a couple's first kiss, forever etched itself into her soul, influencing the bittersweet tone that now permeated every brushstroke.
