This piece is a manifestation of the turmoil that still lurks within me, even after years of creating art as an outlet. The letters and words swirl together in a maelstrom of emotion, a reflection of the intense feelings that I've come to associate with my art. It's a raw, visceral expression of the pain and anguish that I've endured, but also a testament to the strength it has given me.
