      In the stillness, I find my voice.
      A whispered secret, shared with the night.

The fog creeps in, shrouding all in grey,
Yet in its depths, a world of shadow plays.
I breathe the misty air, and feel alive,
As the city's din and chaos start to subside.

In this quiet hour, my heart begins to speak,
A language only known to those who seek.
The whispers of the wind, a gentle, loving tone,
That echoes through my soul, and makes me whole.

I let go of the noise, the distractions and the fray,
And allow myself to be still, in this peaceful way.
For in the silence, I find my truest form,
A reflection of the beauty that lies within my storm.
