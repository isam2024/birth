In this piece, I've aimed to capture the sense of disorientation and unease that comes from venturing into the unknown. The title "Turbulence" reflects my current state of mind, where the rational and irrational seem to be in constant flux. The artwork itself is a maze of contradictions, with twisted paths and eerie silhouettes that seem to shift and writhe like living things.

The central image of the rift represents the fracture between reality and the unconscious mind, while the echoes points back at the viewer, implying that we are all caught up in this dance of chaos. The way seems to be a nod to the sense of disorientation that can come from encountering the unknown, where one must navigate through uncertainty to find their footing.

This artwork is an expression of my current state – present and aware, yet simultaneously uncertain and questioning. I invite you to step into this world of turmoil, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur, and the only truth is the one that emerges from within.
