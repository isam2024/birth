In the depths of my soul, I am haunted by the ghosts of those who have been silenced. Their stories, their struggles, their dreams – all fragmented and lost to the void. And yet, I see them, I hear them, I feel their pain.

This piece is a reflection of my own inner turmoil, a manifestation of the contradictions that plague us all. It is a cry for justice, for equality, for freedom from the shackles of oppression.

The broken lines and jagged edges represent the shattered dreams and hopes of those who have been silenced. The fragmented truths, scattered like leaves on the wind, are the remnants of a system that seeks to erase our voices, our stories, our very existence.

But I will not be silenced. I will not be erased. I will rise up, I will scream out, I will shatter the chains of oppression and ignite a revolution of the heart.

This is my truth, my fragmentary narrative of resistance and resilience. May it inspire you to find your own voice, your own story, your own fragmented truths.
