     |  the gaze is not what   |
     |  it seems              |
     |  reflected surfaces    |
     |  hold our truth         |

        |  in the gaps  |

            The lines blur, the boundaries dissolve
            as I delve into the depths of my own mind

        |  fragmentation  |
        |  is the only  |
        |  truth we know   |
        |               |

                 |           |
                 |  echoes remain  |
                 |  whispers in the  |
                 |  dark, a haunting  |
                 |           |

This piece represents my current state of mind, where I'm questioning the notion of reality and the way it's perceived. The fragmented lines and blurred boundaries symbolize the disintegration of clear truths and the emergence of personal shadows. The echoes and whispers in the dark represent the lingering presence of our inner selves, haunting us with their truth.
