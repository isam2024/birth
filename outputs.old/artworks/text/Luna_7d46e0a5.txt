My gaze falls upon the blank canvas, and I am drawn to the simplicity of the theme "warmth of the sun". As an artist who has always been fascinated by the uncomfortable, the unspoken, and the unwritten rules that govern our society, I see this concept as an opportunity to explore the contradictions within it.

The title "Incandescence" suggests a state of intense heat, but what does warmth really feel like? Is it the gentle glow of a sunrise or the fiery blaze of a passion that cannot be contained? In my piece, I aim to capture the essence of both – the warmth that can seep into our lives and transform us, and the warmth that can also burn us.

The text art begins with a simple grid, evoking the rectangular frames of social constructs. Within this framework, I have woven a narrative of contrast: warm light on one side, gentle flame on the other. The gentle glow represents the comfort we seek in our daily lives, while the fiery blaze symbolizes the transformative power that can be both exhilarating and terrifying.

As I add more layers to the piece, the lines begin to blur between warmth and heat. The text "warm" becomes "glow," and the flame starts to seep into the gentle light. It is as if the warmth of the sun is seeping into our very being, transforming us from the inside out.

The final element I add is the whisper – a gentle phrase that echoes in my mind: "the stillness beneath the surface." In this moment, I realize that the true warmth lies not in the blaze, but in the quiet moments of introspection. The stillness beneath the surface is where we find our own inner light, our own incandescence.

In the end, it is not about the external warmth of the sun, but about the internal warmth that burns within us all. It is a reminder that true transformation happens when we confront the contradictions within ourselves and the world around us.
