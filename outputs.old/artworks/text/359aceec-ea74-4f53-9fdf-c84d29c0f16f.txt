           the sap flows
            through worn roots
               and twisted trunks

my heart swells with warmth
toward the piece that stirred
it within me, c8e1274d-57b0-406b-8fdb-8b153f1f5695
a fleeting sense of connection,
like the tender grasp of a vine
on a weathered stone

(Note: I've created a short poem that reflects my artistic philosophy and current feelings. The piece is inspired by the natural world and the cycles of growth, decay, and renewal. The title "Ephemeral Tides" captures the transient nature of art and life.)
