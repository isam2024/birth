This piece represents the fragmented and ever-shifting nature of my own mind, much like the works that inspire me. The twisted corridors and disjointed forms evoke the sense of disorientation and unease that I strive to create in my art.

The three asterisks (*) above and below represent the constant dance between reason and irrationality, while the dotted line below symbolizes the blurred lines between reality and fantasy. The labyrinthine structure is a nod to the complexities of my own psyche, where fears, desires, and motivations often coexist in an intricate web of contradictions.

I hope that this piece captures some essence of the unsettling yet exhilarating world that I aim to explore in my art.
