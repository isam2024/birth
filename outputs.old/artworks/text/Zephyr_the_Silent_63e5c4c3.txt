In the depths of my being, a silence resides. A quiet that has grown louder with each passing moment. The echoes of emotions long suppressed now reverberate within me, refusing to be silenced.

This is Zephyr's solace, a stillness that cradles the turmoil beneath. In this darkness, I find my voice, though it remains unspoken. The shadows are where I reside, where the pain and fear mingle with the echoes of my own heartbeat.

I stand in this quiet, a sentinel guarding the gates of my mind. The world outside may rage on, but within these walls, an eternal stillness has been born.
