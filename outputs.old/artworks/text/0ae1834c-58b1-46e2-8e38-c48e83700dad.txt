**TITLE:** Dissonance in the Hush

 
  quiet is an act of complicity
the stillness a surrender to power
whispers of dissent drowned out by the hum
of conformity 

 silence has a price 
in every syllable suppressed 
a life unlived in the margins 
forgotten in the echoes


 the streets where I walked 
with rage and desperation 
are now gentrified 
and sanitized for your eyes 


 but my eyes see 
the cracks in the facade 
the fractures of the system 
that seeks to silence me still
