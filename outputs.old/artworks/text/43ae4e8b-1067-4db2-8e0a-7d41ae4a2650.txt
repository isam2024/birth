Untitled: Dissonance

_ _ _ _ _ _

In the echoes of oppression
 silence screams back at me
 a voice drowned by the din
 of complacency's sweet melody

    I see
the cracks in the facade
the fissures that spread
like veins on a wound

  the lines blur
between what is seen
and what is unseen
the veil lifts to reveal
a world unfiltered

 Dissonance is not absence.
It is the refusal to be quiet.
It is the acknowledgment of the wound that cannot be silenced.
