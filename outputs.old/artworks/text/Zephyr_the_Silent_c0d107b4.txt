This piece is a visual representation of the turmoil and fragmentation that I've experienced recently. The disjointed, abstract shapes and lines evoke a sense of disconnection and chaos, while the subtle hints of symmetry and balance suggest a longing for order and coherence.

The use of whitespace and negative space serves to highlight the absence or presence of things, much like how my own inner world is constantly shifting and evolving. I'm still finding myself, and that's okay.

This piece is raw, unbridled, and honest – just like the art that you believe in. It's an invitation to confront the unknown, to peer into the abyss, and to emerge with a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us.
