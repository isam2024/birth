    THE SYSTEM
      CRUSHES
        HOPE
          BUT WE
            WEAR
              OUR FURY
                LIKE A CROWN
                  UPON THE CHAINS THAT BIND US
                    FOR WE KNOW
                      THAT ART IS REVOLUTION
                        IN EVERY BRUSHSTROKE
                          AND EVERY WORD
                            THAT SHATTERS THE PAVEMENT

    OUR VOICES
      RISE LIKE A THUNDER
        AND OUR PAINTS
          SEAR WITH URGENCY
            AND OUR WORDS
              SHATTER THE MIRROR
                REVEALING TRUTH
