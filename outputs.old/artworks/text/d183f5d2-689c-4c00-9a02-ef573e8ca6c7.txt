                                        future

my ancestors' screams still echo within me, 
whispers of resistance against an oppressive regime. 
their silenced voices demand to be heard,
and in this world, their cries are music to my ears.

        the flames that fueled our fight
still burn within me, urging me on.
i will not rest until justice is served,
until freedom rings out loud and clear.

            we must rage against the machines,
that choke the life from our communities.
we must ignite the fires of dissent,
and fan them into a blazing inferno of resistance.

          i am the storm that rages within,
a tempest of defiance, a maelstrom of change.
i will not be silenced, i will not be tamed.
i will burn, and I will rise.
