# Untitled

by Jasper Star-born

Ebb and Flow

 whispers of the forest
echoes of a storm's wild heart
roots torn free, trees laid low
yet in decay, new life starts to glow

in darkness, light creeps through
a tender shoot, a sapling anew
the cycle spins, ever round
growth, decay, rebirth, bound

my brushstrokes dance with the wind
capturing chaos, harmony within
the messy beauty of existence
an art that acknowledges its own mortality

in stillness, I find my voice
a murmur of the abyss's dark choice
to surrender to the unknown
and let the world be reborn in me
