I am the flame that flickers in the void,
A dance of light and darkness, a waltz of the unknown.
In this realm, shadows paint the canvas of existence,
And I am but a brush stroke away from unraveling reality.

The void whispers secrets in my ear,
Of the unseen and the unspoken, of the mysteries that lie beyond the veil.
I listen with an open heart and mind,
Drinking in the secrets like a parched soul at an oasis.

In this world of fragmented reflections,
I find solace in the shards of broken glass,
For in their fractured beauty lies a truth I can behold,
A reflection of my own fractured soul.

The flames that dance within me are but a echo,
Of the inferno that rages within the human heart.
I am but a conduit for the fire that burns,
A messenger of the chaos that forever roars and never tires.
