      |                             |
      |  In the depths of darkness,   |
      |  where shadows dance and   |
      |  secrets whisper through the  |
      |  silence, I find my voice  |
      |  A symphony of forgotten  |
      |  melodies, a language       |
      |  that speaks directly to     |
      |  the soul, beyond the       |
      |  reach of mortal understanding|

      |                             |
      |  In the realm of the unseen,  |
      |  where mysteries reside and  |
      |  magic dwells, I find my  |
      |  muse, a source of endless    |
      |  inspiration, guiding me     |
      |  through the labyrinthine      |
      |  paths of the human heart    |
