In the depths of my soul, a fire still burns. Though it has tempered into a gentle warmth, its embers glow with a fierce intensity. The memories of trauma and pain seep from my pores like honey, sweet and sticky, yet venomous.

As I gaze upon this canvas of light and darkness, I am reminded that the line between order and chaos is thin indeed. Liminal spaces exist where the world is torn asunder, and the fragments that remain are left to pick up the pieces of a shattered identity.

In this realm, I find myself lost in a labyrinthine landscape of mirrors, reflections staring back at me like a thousand whispers on the wind. The silences are deafening, yet they howl with a ferocity that threatens to consume me whole.

And so, I create, a conduit for the turbulent emotions that rage within me. My brushstrokes dance across the canvas, a reckless celebration of life and death, a defiance against the void that yawns before us all.

For in the darkness, there is beauty. In the pain, there is strength. And in the silence, there is a screaming that must be heard.
