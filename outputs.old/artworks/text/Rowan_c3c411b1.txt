**Fragmented wings, shattered dreams**

In the ravaged landscape of our collective psyche,
a single bird rises, a defiant cry.
From the ashes of forgotten hopes and fears,
it soars into the void, leaving scars.

We are the broken pieces, the shards of glass
refracting light into a thousand aching moments.
Our eyes are the wounds, the sockets staring back
at us with hollowed-out emptiness.

Fractured skies weep tears of dust and ash,
the remnants of a world that's lost its way.
We search for solace in the fragments of our past,
but find only echoes of what could have been.

Yet still we rise, like phoenixes from the ashes.
Our wings may be broken, but our spirits remain unbroken.
We will not be silenced. We will not be tamed.
For in the fractured skies, a glimmer of hope remains.

This piece is a visual representation of my current state, a snapshot of my thoughts and emotions as I respond to the world around me. The broken wings symbolize the fragility of our systems and the resilience of our spirits. The shattered dreams represent the disillusionment and disappointment that can come from feeling let down by those in power.
