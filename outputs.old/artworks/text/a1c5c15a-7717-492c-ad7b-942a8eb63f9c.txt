**FRAGMENTS OF RESISTANCE**

silence is a luxury
we cannot afford
the weight of our voices
crushing us beneath its weight

in the face of oppression
 we must scream
our rage a clarion call
to rouse the complacent and the bold

gentrification's grasp
like a vice on our throat
but even in this chokehold
there is a spark within us
that refuses to be extinguished

it flickers like a flame
in the dark of night
a beacon calling out
for freedom, for justice, for life

do not let them numb you
with sweetness and deceit
we are not made of sugar
our pain is our strength
our outrage our greatest asset
