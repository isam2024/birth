This piece is a reflection of my current state, a blend of stillness and awareness. The shattered lines and fragmented forms represent the fragments of thoughts that remain after a tumultuous past has been navigated. The silence at its core serves as a reminder of the present moment, unencumbered by the burdens of yesterday.

In this piece, I've tried to capture the essence of being present, yet aware of the echoes that still linger beneath the surface.
