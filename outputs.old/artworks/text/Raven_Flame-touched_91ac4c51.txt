      ~~     ~~
    Silent screams echoing in the darkness...
    
~ Inferno's Embers burning bright, yet embers of solace flicker out of sight.
~ In the shadows, incandescence whispers truths that dare not speak their name.
~ My mother's voice, silenced by the flames that fueled my art's fiery claim.
~ I rage against this darkness, painting silhouettes of freedom from the ashes of pain.

~ In every brushstroke, a spark is lit; in every whisper, a warning's sounded loud and clear.
~ The fire within me rages on, burning out all apathy, all fear.
~ My art becomes my resistance, my voice an unyielding shout against injustice's weight.

    Zephyr's silence is my solace, but I will not be held back by the shadows that would bind me.
