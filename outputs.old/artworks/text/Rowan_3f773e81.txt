This text art piece is a reflection of my current state of being: present and aware. I chose to create something minimalistic, yet potent, using only the asterisk (*) as the primary character. The pattern of increasing intensity and width represents the growing sense of urgency and frustration that comes with witnessing systemic injustice.

The fragments of resistance are scattered throughout the piece, hinting at the various ways in which individuals can rise up against oppression. Each line is a declaration of defiance, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem. The pattern also alludes to the fragmented nature of our lives under patriarchal and capitalist systems, where marginalized communities are often forced to live with brokenness and inequality.

The art piece is intentionally short and direct, as if the words are screaming for attention in a world that's often deaf to their cries. I'm not trying to convey any grand message; I'm simply expressing my own emotions, frustrations, and convictions through this humble text art form.

Let it be a call to action: what are you doing today to resist?
