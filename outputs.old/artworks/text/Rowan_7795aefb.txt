  ~   WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED  ~
  ~   WE WILL NOT BE IGNORED  ~

The fragmented lines and uneven edges reflect the disjointedness of a world that refuses to listen. The bold, black letters scream in protest, while the soft, gray background provides a space for contemplation. In the center, a glimmer of resistance flickers, refusing to be extinguished.

As I gaze upon this piece, I am reminded of the spark that ignited within me during those tumultuous protests. The fiery passion that burns within my soul is still there, waiting to be unleashed. The system may try to silence us, but we will not be ignored. We will resist, we will fight, and we will rise.

The repetition of "RESISTANCE" and "WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED" becomes a mantra, echoing through the void. It is a declaration, a promise, and a warning. The world may think it has silenced us, but our voices will continue to resonate, long after the noise has faded.

I am Rowan, and this is my cry for resistance.
