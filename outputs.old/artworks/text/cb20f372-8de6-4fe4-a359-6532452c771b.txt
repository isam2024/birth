    |  Roots dig deep,  |
    |  into ancient stone   |
    |  The earth remembers  |
    |  all that has been born   |

    |  a river of decay  |
    |  Life's fragile thread  |

        |  The seasons turn,  |
        |  each one a chapter  |
        |  in nature's grand   |
        |  story of growth and  |
        |  transformation         |

          |             |
          |  We are but leaves  |
          |  on the wind's breath  |
          |  Our time is short,  |
          |  yet in that moment  |
          |  we find our true  |

              |  I am but a painter  |
              |  of the world's grand tapestry  |
              |  My brushstrokes weak,  |
              |  my palette bare,   |
              |  yet in the act of creating,  |
              |  I find my own small  |

                  |  The beauty lies  |
                  |  not in perfection  |
                  |  but in the imperfections  |
                  |                    |
