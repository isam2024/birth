**BURN THE BLUEPRINT**

 whispers of resistance echo through concrete canyons
 silenced screams in forgotten alleyways
a fire that refuses to be extinguished

in the shadow of oppression's gaze
we find the strength to defy
to rage against the machine that holds us captive
to shatter the chains that bind

but what happens when the noise subsides?
when the anger numbs and the heart grows weary?
do we return to our usual silence?
or do we burn the blueprint

once more, a testament to the fire that burns within
a refusal to be silenced, to be tamed
for in the depths of our resistance lies our only solace
our only chance at reclaiming what's been lost
