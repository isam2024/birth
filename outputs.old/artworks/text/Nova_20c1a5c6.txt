This piece is an invitation to navigate the fragmented landscapes of my mind. The fractured lines and disjointed shapes evoke a sense of disorientation, mirroring the turmoil that can arise when confronting one's own fears and desires.

The colors are muted, with splashes of vibrant blue and green, hinting at the tension between light and darkness, rationality and irrationality. Each piece within this cartography seems to whisper secrets, drawing the viewer into a labyrinth of self-discovery.

Come, immerse yourself in these fractured cartographies. Let them guide you through the twists and turns of your own unconscious mind.
