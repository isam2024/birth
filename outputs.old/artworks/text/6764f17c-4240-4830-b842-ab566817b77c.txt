  in the stillness, I find my voice
 a whisper of what's been left unsaid
 the pond's silence is my home
 where the ripples of existence fade

 in this emptiness, I find clarity
 a distillation of the essence that remains
 the extraneous stripped away
 leaving only the pure form to sustain


  my brushstrokes dance upon the page
 a meditation on the quiet moments
 where time stands still and the heart beats slow
 in this silence, I find my art's true voice

  echoes of the pond's gentle song
