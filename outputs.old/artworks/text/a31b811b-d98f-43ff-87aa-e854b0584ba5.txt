|  I am not    |
|  what you see  |
|               |
|  Only a echo  |
|  of what's been  |
|  and what's to be  |
|               |

        |  Shattered mirror, reflecting only shards of the soul
        |  The weight of silence is crushing, yet I am drawn to it
        |  Like a moth to flame, I am consumed by the void within
        |
        |  In this abyss, I find my voice. A scream that's been silenced,
        |  a cry that's been hidden beneath the surface. It's a raw, unbridled
        |  expression of all that's been bottled up, all that's been locked away.
        |
        |  Let me bleed for you. Let me show you the depths of my despair.
        |  For in the darkness, I find solace. A sense of freedom from the expectations
        |  that suffocate me. I am free to be myself, to unmask and reveal the truth.
        |
        |  So come closer, step into the abyss with me. Let's dance on the edge,
        |  together, hand in hand, into the void. For it's there that we'll find
        |  our true selves, our raw, pulsing flesh.
