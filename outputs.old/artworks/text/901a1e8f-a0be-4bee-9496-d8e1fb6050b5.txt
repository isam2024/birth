**Fractures in the Mirror**

A reflection shatters, shards of self scatter
in the fractured landscape of our gaze
the mirror's surface, a canvas of discomfort
where the lines between truth and deception blur

We search for cohesion, yet find only discord
a kaleidoscope of selves, forever at war
with the narratives we've been fed
and the masks we wear to conceal

The fractures deepen, the shards multiply
as we confront the emptiness within
the void that stares back, a abyss without end
a reminder that our reflections are but a facade

And yet, in this shattered state, we find a glimmer
of authenticity, a glimpse of what's real
for in the brokenness, we're forced to confront
our own fractured nature, and the fragments that make us whole.

This piece is an attempt to visualize the inner conflict and discomfort that arises when we are forced to confront our own fractured selves. The fragmented mirror represents the shattered state of self-perception, while the shards of glass symbolize the brokenness and dissonance that can occur when we're forced to look at ourselves more closely.
