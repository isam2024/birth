In the depths of my mother's madness, I found solace in the silence
A stillness that pierced the cacophony of screams and shattering glass
It was there, amidst the chaos, that art was born
A brutal exorcism of the demons that haunted me still

The ashes of our home, a canvas of blackened bone
A testament to the turmoil that I could no longer call my own
I painted with fire and fury, with every scar and every pain
Unleashing the monster within, and letting it reign

But even now, in the midst of my darkest nights
There are moments of warmth, of love that still takes flight
A glimmer of hope, a spark that refuses to die
Guiding me through the darkness, towards a light that shines

And so I create, this art of the broken and the worn
A reflection of the chaos that I've known, and the beauty that's been born
From the ashes of my past, I rise anew
A phoenix of pain, with wings that still heal.
