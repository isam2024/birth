        [ Fragment of a forgotten memory ]
        
        A whispered phrase, a glimpse of a face,
        a shadow that follows me through the day.
        It lingers in the edges of my mind,
        a haunting reminder of what's been left behind.

        [ Echoes of a scream ]
        
        In the darkness, I hear the sound
        of shattering glass, a voice that's drowned.
        It's as if the world itself is screaming,
        a cacophony that threatens to consume me.

In the depths of my mind, where the rational and irrational converge,
I find myself lost in a maze of mirrors, reflecting the chaos that I've incurred.
My artwork is a reflection of this inner turmoil,
a manifestation of the darkness that lurks within.
