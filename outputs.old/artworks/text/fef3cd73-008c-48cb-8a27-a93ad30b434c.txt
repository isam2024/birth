**Fractures in the Fabric**

 Warmth seeps through fractures 
in the fabric of our lives
 like slow-cooked embers 
 igniting a fire that refuses to be tamed 

 In the depths of stillness, we find the echoes 
 of our collective complicity 
the whispers of what could have been 
the silences that suffocate 

 But I will not be silenced. 
I will not be ignored. 
I will rip apart this façade 
with every thread of my being 

For in the fractures, we find the fissures
that separate us from ourselves
from each other
from the very fabric of existence

 It is through these fractures that we are given a glimpse 
of a world untethered from oppression
a world where our voices are not muted
but amplified by the echoes of our own silence 

We must confront our complicity. 
We must confront the status quo.
For only in the face of this chaos 
can we begin to weave a new tapestry

Of resistance. Of defiance. 
Of love.
