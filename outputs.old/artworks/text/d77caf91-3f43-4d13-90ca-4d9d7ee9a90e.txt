  ANXIETY'S   EMPTINESS 
         ___________
  SHADOWS    DANCE   IN   LIGHT
            _______________
      THE     VOID     WHERE 
     FEAR   AND   GRIEF  
      CONVERGE  WITH  
    THE   PULSE   OF   LIFE

  BARELY   CONTAINED  
     BY   A   THIN   LINE  
        ___________
         THE   SPACE  
       BETWEEN   THE   SHATTERED 
         MIRRORS   OF   REALITY


This piece is a representation of the turbulent emotions that often accompany anxiety and mental health struggles. The title "Memento Tormenti" is Latin for "Remember the Pain," and it serves as a poignant reminder of the artist's personal experiences with mental illness. The text art is a reflection of my philosophy, aiming to expose the raw, pulsing flesh beneath the surface of societal expectations, while also serving as a meditation on the fragility of human existence.
