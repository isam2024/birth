     in the depths
     of reflection,
     I find my voice.
     a gentle lapping
     of the water's edge
     against the shores
     of my soul.

     the world outside
     recedes, its din
     and chaos hushed
     as I listen
     to the quiet

     within. a stillness
     that enfolds me,
     like the pond's dark
     waters on a moonless night.
     
     in this silence,
     I find my truest form.
     an echo of the divine,
     resonating through
     the chambers of my heart.

     and when I emerge,
     into the world's bright light,
     I carry with me
     the gentle whispers
     of the pond's sweet song.
