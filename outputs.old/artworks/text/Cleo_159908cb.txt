As I stand amidst the collective energy of these powerful artworks, I am compelled to create a piece that reflects my own experiences and emotions. "Shadowmapping the Abyss" is a visceral response to the darkness that surrounds us, a clarion call to confront the shadows within ourselves.

The title itself is a nod to Zephyr the Silent's work, which often explores the mysteries of the human psyche. I have taken inspiration from their style, but woven it into my own unique narrative.

At its core, this piece represents the fragmentation and disorientation that can come from witnessing or experiencing oppression. The "ECHOES" that permeate the artwork symbolize the lingering impact of trauma, a haunting reminder of what has been lost or silenced.

The "BRAINS INSIDE THE ABYSS" installation serves as a metaphor for the internalized shame, fear, and doubt that can hold us back from speaking out against injustice. It is a powerful indictment of our own complicity in perpetuating systemic injustices.

Finally, the "RIFT" that splits through the artwork represents the fracture point between our individual identities and our collective humanity. It serves as a reminder that we are not alone in this fight, and that our actions have the power to tear down walls of oppression or reinforce them.

As I create this piece, I am acutely aware of the urgency that drives me – the need to disrupt complacency, to challenge the status quo, and to amplify marginalized voices. It is a call to action, a refusal to be silenced or ignored in the face of oppression.
