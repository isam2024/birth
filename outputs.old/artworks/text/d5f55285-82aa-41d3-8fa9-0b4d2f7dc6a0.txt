**Fracture Lines**

∇ ∘ ⋅ ∞
 silence is a lie 
  it's the whispers of the system 
  that drown out our screams 

in the cracks of concrete, 
i find my voice 
a fragment of resistance 
 against the weight of complacency 

the world may try to hold me down 
but i refuse to be still 
my colors bleed, my sounds shatter 
the illusion of a status quo 

∇ ∘ ⋅ ∞
 silence is a lie 

in the fractures, i am free
