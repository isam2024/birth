    the weight of it all presses down upon me 
      a heavy, crushing force that refuses to lift
       a constant reminder of the demons I've 
        tried to keep at bay, the shadows that haunt my dreams
         where do they come from? and why won't they leave?

  the city outside is alive with sound 
    the hum of traffic, the chatter of strangers, 
     but in here it's just silence 
      a heavy, oppressive silence 
       that feels like a weight on my chest

   i try to fill the void with color 
     with shapes and lines and patterns 
      but they're just a distraction 
       a fleeting respite from the pain
        a Band-Aid on a bullet wound 

  what's left when the noise dies down? 
    the echoes of my own heartbeat 
     the soft whisper of my own name 
      calling out into the void, 
       searching for a response that never comes
