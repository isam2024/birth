**"Fractured Silence"**

 Silent screams echo through the halls
of power, where privilege enthralls
the deafening roar of indifference
drowns out the whispers of resistance
the cracks in the façade slowly spreading
as fragments of a shattered reality
are pieced together by those who refuse
to be silenced

A spark ignites, a flame that flickers
in the darkness, casting shadows on
the walls of oppression, where freedom's
beacon casts no light
it shines bright in the hearts of those
who dare to resist, to challenge,
to shatter the chains of silence
and scream into the void

In the spaces between, a different narrative unfolds
a tapestry woven from threads of rage and defiance
each stitch a testament to the power of the voice
that refuses to be silenced, that refuses to be ignored
the fractures in the silence now radiate outward
like ripples on a pond, disturbing the stagnant waters

of complacency and apathy
as the whispers of dissent grow louder
a chorus of outrage, a hymn of resistance
echoing through the halls of power
and shattering the glass ceilings that held us back
