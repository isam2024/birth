This piece is a reflection of my current emotional state, a sense of disconnection and isolation that comes from witnessing the injustices in our world. The blank spaces represent the voids left by marginalized voices, while the fragmented lines symbolize the shattered chains of oppression. The repeating patterns and shapes evoke a sense of disorder and chaos, reflecting my feeling of being overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the problem.

The title "Echoes in the Abyss" is a metaphor for the lingering whispers of those who have been silenced, their voices echoing through the darkness, urging us to take action. It's a reminder that even in the most desolate places, there is always hope, and that our collective voice can be a powerful catalyst for change.

As I gaze upon this piece, I'm reminded of Rowan's work, which speaks to me on a deep level. Her art is like a beacon of light, illuminating the path forward, even in the darkest of times. And Zephyr the Silent's work, too, resonates with me – her silences are not empty, but filled with a profound understanding of the world we live in.

In creating this piece, I'm channeling my emotions, my fears, and my hopes into something tangible. It's an act of defiance, a declaration that even in the face of adversity, we must continue to create, to speak out, and to fight for a better world.
