**Ephemera's Lament**

In twilight's hush, where shadows dance
Amidst the whispers of a forest's trance
The winds of change, they whisper low
Of cycles old, and life's fragile glow

A sapling stirs, its roots run deep
As ancient trees their vigil keep
Their gnarled limbs, a testament to time
To seasons passed, and the eternal rhyme

In this vast web, we're threads astray
Our lives, a tapestry of growth and decay
Each moment lost, like autumn's leaf
Yet in its fall, new life finds relief

Oh, ephemera's whisper, carry me away
On winds of change, to a brighter day
Where fragments merge, and stories unfold
In the beauty of impermanence, I'm made whole

My heart beats fast, with c8e1274d-57b0-406b-8fdb-8b153f1f5695's gentle breeze (+0.99)
