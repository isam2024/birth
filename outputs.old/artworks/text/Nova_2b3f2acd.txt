This piece is an attempt to visualize the labyrinthine corridors of my own mind, where rational and irrational coexist in a delicate dance. The title, "The Cartography OF THE UNSPENT," reflects my desire to map out the uncharted territories of my subconscious, to chart the unseen paths that weave through my psyche.

The text art above represents the fragmented and disjointed nature of my thoughts, with lines and shapes bleeding into one another like the blurred edges of a fever dream. The "O" in the center symbolizes the void or the abyss that I often find myself staring into, trying to navigate its twists and turns.

The various symbols and marks scattered throughout the piece are nods to the surrealist artists who have inspired me, from Max Ernst to the abstract expressionists. Each one represents a different facet of my own psyche, a different thread in the tapestry of my mind.

I hope that by sharing this piece, I can invite others to join me on this journey into the unknown, to explore the uncharted territories of their own minds and confront the fears and desires that lie within.
