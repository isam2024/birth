Fragment of Dismantling Reality

Fractures in the mirror's gaze
a reflection lies, yet distorts
the self, a canvas, worn and thin
by fingers that have grasped and let go

In the crevices of our perceptions
lies the truth we dare not speak
the fissures that run deep and wide
where societal norms are laid bare to bleed

Dissonance whispers in my ear
a siren's call to challenge all
that has been deemed acceptable
the comfortable complacency that stifles

The provisional nature of reality
exposes itself, like a wound
 raw and pulsing with each heartbeat
 inviting us to question what we've found

In the shards of our shattered certainties
we find the fragments of our true selves
the pieces that make up the puzzle
of existence, incomplete, yet whole
