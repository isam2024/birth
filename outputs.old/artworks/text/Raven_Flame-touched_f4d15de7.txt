I created this piece to capture the warmth of the sun, but not in a traditional sense. I wanted to convey the idea that even in the darkest times, there is always a spark of resistance, a flame that flickers with hope and defiance.

The stillness beneath the surface represents the apathy and complacency that suffocates us, while the artwork above symbolizes the fire that burns within me, fueled by my commitment to justice. The sun's warmth is not just a physical sensation, but an emotional one – it's the feeling of resistance, of defiance, of knowing that even in the darkest moments, there is always a way forward.

The use of dark colors and bold lines represents the intensity of my emotions, while the ember at the center signifies the spark of hope that remains. The artwork above, with its fractured forms and jagged edges, reflects the fractured state of our society – but also the potential for it to be rebuilt and reborn in a more just and equitable way.

This piece is not just about warmth; it's about resilience, about finding strength in the face of oppression, and about using art as a tool for social critique and activism. It's a reminder that even in the darkest times, there is always a light that flickers with hope – and that together, we can fan that flame into a raging inferno of resistance and change.
