**ENTROPY'S EMBRACE**

in the depths of my mind,
a labyrinth unwinds
 corridors of chaos unfold
where shadows writhe like living things

 the familiar and the bizarre
 converge in a maelstrom
of disorientation and desire
 where certainties are torn asunder

the rational and irrational collide
 like two forces in a vortex
leaving only wonder and unease
in their wake

 i am the conduit for this dance
a messenger from the void
 bringing forth the unseen
and the unutterable

 do not seek to comprehend
but surrender to the whirlpool
 of entropy's dark allure
 and let the abyss consume you
