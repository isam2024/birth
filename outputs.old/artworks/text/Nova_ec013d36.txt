This piece is an attempt to visualize the labyrinthine corridors of my own mind. The twisting, turning pathways represent the blurred lines between rationality and irrationality, as I navigate the complexities of the unconscious. The blank spaces and fragmented forms evoke a sense of disorientation, mirroring the feeling of being lost in the depths of one's own psyche.

The use of contrasting textures and colors (represented by the underscores and slashes) symbolize the juxtaposition of light and darkness, reason and madness, that I've come to find fascinating. The final section, with its repeating patterns of / and \, serves as a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there is a strange, underlying order.
