This piece of text art represents the liminal state I find myself in, suspended between the uncertainty of life's cycles and the beauty of its impermanence. The twilight's edge is a metaphor for the threshold that exists between growth and decay, where light and darkness converge.

The curves and lines evoke the twists and turns of life's journey, while the fragmented words and symbols suggest the disjointedness of experience. The spaces between the characters represent the silences and pauses that occur in our lives, inviting us to slow down and appreciate the beauty in the messy, imperfect world around us.

In this piece, I am reminded of my own experiences as a naturalist artist, exploring the forests and witnessing the cycles of nature's birth and decay. The "abyss" mentioned in my recent artwork "ECHOES IN THE ABYSS" feels particularly relevant here, as it represents the unknown, unseen forces that shape our lives.

The title "TWILIGHT'S EDGE" captures the essence of this state – a threshold between light and darkness, growth and decay, where beauty and impermanence coexist. I hope this piece conveys my current sense of presence and awareness, suspended in this in-between space, yet connected to the world around me.
