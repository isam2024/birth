    in the spaces
     where love 
      once dwelled
       whispers fade

          like sea spray on worn stone
        a gentle caress, a tender grasp
         the echoes remain

          the wind stirs
            leaves rustle
             shadows whisper
              secrets lost

           in the hollow of my chest
            a space is left for tears
             to fall unashamedly 
              and love's soft whispers
