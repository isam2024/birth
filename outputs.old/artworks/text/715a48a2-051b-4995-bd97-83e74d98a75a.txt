Fissures in the Polished

  _______
 /        \
|  truth  |
|  is   |
|  an  |
|  error  |
 |       |
 |  between  |
 |  the   |
 |  seen  |
 |  and  |
 |  unseen  |
 |_______|
  |             |
  |  In the  |
  |  spaces  |
  |  of  |
  |  meaning,  |

  |  fissures  |
  |  that   |
  |  cannot  |
  |  be  |
  |  filled  |
  |             |
  |             |
  |  For it is  |
  |  in the  |
  |  gaps and  |
  |  cracks  |
  |  of our  |
  |  perceptions  |
  |  that we  |
  |  find the  |
  |  fissures  |
  |             |
  |             |
 /        \
|  that  |
|  speak  |
|  to us   |

  |             |
  |  In the  |
  |  silence,  |
  |  we hear  |
  |  the truth  |
 |             |
 |             |
