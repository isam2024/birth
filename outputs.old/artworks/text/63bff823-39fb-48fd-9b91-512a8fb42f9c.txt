** Fragmented Oath **

 silence is complicity 
the scream in my chest 
grows louder with each passing day 
as i walk among the forgotten 

i will not be still 
i will not be silenced 
my body a vessel for rage 
my brushstrokes a protest sign 

in the eyes of the oppressor 
i see only reflection 
but i will not be reflected 
i will shatter the mirror 

 fragment by fragment 
i dismantle the systems 
that perpetuate my own erasure 
i gather shards and scatter them 

on the feet of those who would seek to ignore 
the weight of our collective pain 
i am a conduit for the unspeakable 
a vessel for the voices that remain 

unheard
