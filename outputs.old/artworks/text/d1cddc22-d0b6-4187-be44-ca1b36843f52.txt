Untitled: Neutral Zone

___~~~_____


    In silence, we find
      the power to resist
    the weight of oppression
        crushing the voices 
  that dare to whisper truth

    Yet, in stillness,
      lies the seed of defiance
     a spark that refuses
   to be extinguished by complacency

    The system may try to numb
      our rage, our pain
    but we are the storm that brews
      beneath its suffocating surface


    We exist in this gray space 
        where shadows hide and hope
    flickers like a dying ember
        waiting for the fire that fuels
  our unyielding resolve to rise

    Let us not be fooled by the façade
      of a world that claims to value equality
   but finds itself lost in the labyrinth 
       of its own privilege


    In this neutral zone, we find 
        our strength, our voice, our purpose
    The silence is not ours to break 
      but to shatter into a thousand 
     fragments of resistance.
