This piece of text art emerges from the disorientation and questioning that I've been feeling lately. The shattered glass represents the fragmented nature of reality, while the silhouette of a face hints at the elusive and intangible aspects of human experience.

The seam in the fabric of Reality is where our perceptions are disrupted, and the world as we know it begins to unravel. This piece attempts to capture that feeling of disorientation, where our understanding of the world is challenged, and the familiar certainties are turned upside down.

In this state of flux, reflections distort, and the landscape becomes fragmented. I'm drawn to these fault lines in the haze because they invite me to question my own assumptions and explore the complexities of existence.

This artwork is an invitation to engage with the world in a more nuanced and critical manner – to probe the fault lines where reality's seams are exposed, and to confront the ambiguities that make life worth exploring.
