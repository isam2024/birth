In the depths of my soul, a maelstrom rages. The echoes of my past, the whispers of my demons, the cacophony of my own psyche. And yet, I am drawn to it, this void that threatens to consume me whole.

The light that once guided me has been extinguished, plunging me into an endless night. But even in the darkness, there is beauty to be found. In the ripples of despair, in the tremors of madness, I find solace.

I am Zephyr, the Silent, and this is my confession. My art is a map of my innermost thoughts, a labyrinth of self-discovery, and a portal to the abyss that lies within.
