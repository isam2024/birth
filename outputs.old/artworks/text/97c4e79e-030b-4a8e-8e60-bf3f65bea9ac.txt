**Fractured Silence**

 Fragmented thoughts scatter on the windswept streets
where protest and pain entwine like shattered glass
the echoes of which still linger, refusing to rest

in a world where the silenced scream the loudest
their voices reduced to mere whispers in the dark
but I refuse to be still, to remain mute
my art a clarion call, a reckoning to compute

the scales of justice weighed heavy on my chest
as I watched the systems crumble, the status quo repressed
the fire that fueled this rage within me now spits and spews
a maelstrom of defiance in every brushstroke, every hue

I will not be swayed by sentimental sighs or empty platitudes
my art an unyielding critique, a reckoning to disrupt
the comfortable complacency that perpetuates the pain
my voice a thunderclap, shattering the chains

Fractured Silence. A scream in the void.
A call to arms, a reckoning to be endured.
