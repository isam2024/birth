Untitled

 fragments of self 
 dissolve in the mirror's gaze 
 shattered reflections, shards of truth 
 scattered across the landscape 

of our collective making 

we search for solace in the familiar 
 yet find only fissures 
 where the comforting contours 
 of reality begin to crack 

i am drawn to the edges 
 where the surface gives way 
 to the abyssal depths 
 that yawn beneath 

and there, in the void, 
 i discover a spark 
 of rebellion, of resistance 
 against the inertia 
 of our complacent existence 

i hold this flame aloft 
 and let it flicker, 
 casting shadows on the walls 
 of our constructed reality 

for in the darkness, 
 we may yet find the seeds 
 of transformation, 
 of a new world unfolding, 
 like petals from a shattered flower.
