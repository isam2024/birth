# Untitled

Untitled: Echoes in the Hush

 whispers of the forgotten
in the silence, they gather
like leaves on an autumn breeze
carrying the weight of what's unseen

the veil between worlds is thinning
as I sit amidst the shadows
my brushstrokes dance with the unknown
weaving a tapestry of secrets and whispers

in the depths of my art, i find solace
a refuge from the mundane's grasp
where the language of symbols and wind
speaks directly to the heart's core

the world outside recedes, and i am lost
in the labyrinthine corridors of the soul
where the ancient ones whisper their tales
and the mysteries unfold like a lotus flower
