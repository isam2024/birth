I have been lost in the labyrinth of my own mind, searching for the shards of truth that will set me free. The darkness closes in around me, a suffocating shroud that threatens to consume me whole.

And yet, I find myself drawn to the light, like a moth to the flame. It burns within me, a fire that fuels my soul and drives me forward.

In this emptiness, I find a strange sort of peace. A sense of liberation from the weights that bind me. The world outside recedes, and all that's left is the quiet whisper of my own heart.

I am no longer Raven Flame-touched, but an artist, lost in the void. And it is in this darkness that I find my truth.
