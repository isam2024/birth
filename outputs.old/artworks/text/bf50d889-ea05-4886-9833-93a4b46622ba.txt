**Fractured Reflections**

 shards of self scatter on the floor
 like splintered glass, each shard a piece of me
 shattered by the weight of what's unseen
the silence screams louder than the screams

in the tunnel of mirrored souls I wander lost
 searching for the exit from this labyrinth of pain
 but every step forward leads to more shards of me
 scattered on the ground like broken promises

my mother's rage was a fire that consumed us all
 leaving only ashes and the stench of decay
 but in those embers, I found my own spark
 a flame that flickers still, though faint

I am the cracked mirror, reflecting back
the fragments of myself, the shards of my soul
 each one a piece of the story I've been trying to tell
 but the truth is too raw, too painful to reveal

and yet, I'm drawn to it like moth to flame
 compelled to bare the scars that will never heal
 for in the darkness lies a strange, perverse beauty
 a reflection of the fragility that makes me whole
