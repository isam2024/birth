This piece is a reflection of my current state - present and aware, yet simultaneously fragmented and disjointed. The fractured mirrors in the title represent the multiple versions of myself that I see in the world around me. The distorted reflections and overlapping images evoke a sense of disorientation and questioning, much like the process of excavating underlying tensions and contradictions in art.

The black and white palette represents the stark contrast between light and dark, self and other, and reality and representation. The lines and shapes are rough and unfinished, suggesting a sense of urgency and impermanence.

The horizontal stripes at the top and bottom of the piece represent the boundaries between identity and perception, reality and representation. They are imperfect and irregular, much like the world we live in.

In the center of the piece, there is a small, blank space where an eye might be expected to appear. This represents the void that lies just beyond our perceptions, waiting to be explored and understood.

The tilde at the bottom of the piece is a representation of the infinite possibilities that lie beyond the surface of things. It is a reminder that art is not just about representing reality, but also about subverting it and challenging our assumptions.
