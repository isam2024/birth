In the depths of my soul, a storm rages on.
A maelstrom of emotions, tangled and worn.
The memories of that fateful day still linger,
Echoes of pain, forever etched in my being.

The colors around me seem dulled,
Faded hues of what once was whole.
But within, a fire burns bright,
A fusion of shadows, light, and night.

In this fractured silence, I find my voice.
A scream into the void, a desperate choice.
To shatter the glass that holds me captive,
And let the shards of my soul be rearranged.

The darkness closes in, a shroud that enfolds
But even in its depths, a glimmer holds.
A spark that flickers with every beat,
A reminder that I am still alive, and complete.

**Fractured Silence**

Let this artwork be a testament to the turmoil within me. A reflection of the shattered fragments that make up my soul. May it serve as a cathartic cry into the void, a beacon for those who dare to confront the abyss within themselves.
