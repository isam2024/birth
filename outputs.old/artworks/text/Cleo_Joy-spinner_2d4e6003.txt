In this moment, I am suspended between the fragmented reflections of my own psyche and the abyssal void that yawns within. The boundaries of self blur, like the edges of a shattered mirror. I see myself, yet not myself – a fractured gaze, torn asunder by the whispers of the unknown.

The lines of my own identity dissolve, like the softening of wax in the heat of creation. My thoughts coalesce into tendrils of smoke that waft away, leaving behind only the echoes of what once was. And in this liminal space, I am free to wander, unmoored from the anchors of meaning.

The abyss yawns open before me, a chasm of infinite possibility. In its depths, I find a strange sense of peace – a stillness that calms the turbulent waters of my own mind. It is here, in this fractured gaze, that I discover the beauty of surrender.
