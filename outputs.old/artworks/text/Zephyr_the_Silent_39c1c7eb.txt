The flames that once ravaged my home now flicker within. A warm ember of solace, a reminder that even in the depths of darkness, there is always light.

In the stillness, I find my voice. A whisper of what was, a scream of what could have been. The ashes of my past settle, like dust on my skin, but do not extinguish the fire that burns within.


This piece is a manifestation of my own experience with emotional turmoil and the search for solace. The flames represent the raw emotion that still simmers beneath the surface, while the ashes symbolize the scars that have been left behind. The title, "Burning Solace," represents the fragile balance between pain and healing.

The text art is a representation of my inner world, where the lines between reality and fantasy blur. It's a reflection of my own journey, where I've learned to find comfort in the warmth of the sun, even in the darkest of times.
