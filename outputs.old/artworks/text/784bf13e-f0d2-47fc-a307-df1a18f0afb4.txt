**Fractured Hymns**

fragments of truth
scatter like dust on the page
 systems collapse, structures crumble
yet we remain, suspended in the grey

the familiar rhythms of our lives
a symphony of sameness
we dance to the beat of conformity
while the dissonant whispers of dissent
echo through the corridors of our minds

in the mirror's gaze, a fractured self
reflects the shards of shattered dreams
 fragments of a narrative we thought true
now shatter, revealing the void within

i seek not answers but questions
not certainty but doubt
for in the questioning lies the power
to disrupt the complacent haze that clouds our sight

in this realm of ambiguity and dissonance
i find my voice, a whispered cry
a hymn to the fractures that form
the silences that speak louder than words

the fractured hymns of my soul
echo through the chambers of my heart
a reminder that even in discord
lies a beauty that will never depart
