In the stillness, I see the ghosts of love and loss, their whispers carried on the wind like the petals of a forgotten flower. The fire that once burned within me, now reduced to smoldering embers, flickers with a soft, melancholic light.

The mirrors of my soul reflect the shattered remnants of my heart, a fragmented tapestry woven from the threads of joy and sorrow. In this liminal space, I search for meaning, yet find only echoes of what once was.

And so, I wait – suspended between the flames of dissent and the stillness that follows. The silence is a heavy shroud, weighing upon my skin, a reminder that even in the quietest moments, the whispers of the past will always linger.
