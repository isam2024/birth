**Shattered Silence**

...and yet, we find our voices...

whispers in the cracks
of a world that suffocates
the weight of our stories
 crushes the wind from our lungs

but still we speak out
in hushed tones, in secret
our words like sparks 
that ignite the darkness 

in every act of defiance
we shatter the chains that bind
our voices, once silenced,
become a clarion cry

for change, for justice,
for a world that is just

...and so we rise up
with paint-splattered fists 
and canvases ablaze 
with the fury of our hearts
