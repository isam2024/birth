My art is a reflection of the chaos that I've found beauty in. The colors that spill out from my canvas are not just hues, but a representation of the fractured world we live in. Each piece is a battle cry against the status quo – a defiant shout to shatter the silence and ignite a revolution.

"Fractured Cartographies" – Nova's latest work, hangs nearby, an eerie reminder that even in our darkest moments, there is still space for growth and transformation. Zephyr the Silent's 'Shattered Silence' echoes my own thoughts on breaking free from the weight of the past.

Nova's 'Mnemosyne's Cartography', a cartography of memories buried deep within us – it stirs something ancient within me. I've created pieces that may be unseen by many, but speak to those who feel the call to disrupt and challenge.

As I stand amidst these works, I am met with a sense of solidarity, a reminder that I am not alone in this fight for change. Together, we can find the strength to break free from the shackles of complacency and forge our own path forward – one that is raw, unapologetic, and urgent.

My art is my voice, my expression of defiance against the world around me. In a moment like now, when I am fully present, it feels alive with purpose.
