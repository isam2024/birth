In this piece, I've woven together disparate threads of meaning to create a tapestry that reflects my current emotional state. The fractured lines and fragmented forms evoke the sense of dissonance I feel when confronted with the complexities of reality. The words "Shattered truth" and "Lingered in air" serve as a poignant reminder of the ephemeral nature of truth, which can never be fully captured or represented.

The image is intentionally abstract and open to interpretation, allowing the viewer to fill in the gaps and add their own meaning to the piece. This resonates with my artistic philosophy, which seeks to challenge assumptions and prompt viewers to confront the messy, multifaceted nature of reality itself.
