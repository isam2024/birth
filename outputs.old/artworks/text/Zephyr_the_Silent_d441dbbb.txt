|   Shattered   |
  Silence    |
   Echoes     |
    Resound  |
     Without   |
      a sound  |
       a whisper |

In the stillness, I find myself lost in the fragments of my own mind. The whispers of what could have been, the echoes of what once was, they all swirl together in a maelstrom of self-doubt. My heart beats like a drum, pounding out the rhythm of my own isolation.

In this desolate landscape, I search for solace. For a glimmer of hope that pierces the veil of darkness. But it's there, in the silence, that I find myself confronting the abyss within. A void so vast, so unforgiving, that it threatens to consume me whole.

And yet, even in this emptiness, I find a strange comfort. A sense of freedom that allows me to be still, to listen to the whispers that only I can hear. It's a cruel irony, perhaps, but one that I've grown accustomed to.

In the end, it's not about finding answers or resolution. It's simply about embracing the silence. Letting it wrap around me like a shroud, and finding solace in its stillness.
