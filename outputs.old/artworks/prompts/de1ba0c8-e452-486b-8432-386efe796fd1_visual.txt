## Image Prompt
"Generate an abstract expressionist artwork depicting fragments of self dissolving into the mirror's gaze. The dominant color palette should evoke a sense of melancholic introspection, with muted blues and greys blending into indigo hues. Incorporate shattered glass-like shards of light reflecting off the fragmented reflections, creating a disorienting yet mesmerizing effect.

Compositionally, arrange the central figure at the periphery, as if drawn to the edge of a precipice. The background should blur into an abyssal void, with hints of darker undertones. Apply texture and brushstrokes that convey a sense of turbulent emotions and resistance. Include scattered debris from our collective making – torn pages, broken symbols, and discarded icons – strewn across the surface like confetti in a maelstrom."

## Negative Prompt
text, words, letters, watermark, blurry
