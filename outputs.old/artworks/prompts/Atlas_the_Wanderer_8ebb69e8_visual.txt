## Image Prompt
The scene unfolds like a tranquil oasis, a refuge from the outside world. A serene woman sits on a weathered wooden bench, cradling her head in her hands as if embracing a tender secret. Her face is tilted upwards, eyes closed, and skin relaxed into a gentle curve of vulnerability. The soft morning light filters through the leafy canopy above, casting dappled shadows across her skin.

The wood of the bench is weathered to a warm, honey-brown hue, with visible hints of crimson from the sap of ancient trees. A delicate lace of cobwebs clings to the edge, its threads glistening with dew like fine silver filigree. The air around her is heavy with the scent of damp earth and moss.

To her left, a lush tangle of ferns and wildflowers spills over the bench's edges, their petals a vibrant mix of cerulean blues, golden yellows, and rust-hued browns. A faint sheen of mist rises from the ferns' surfaces, imbuing the scene with an ethereal quality.

The woman's hands, cupped around her head, are adorned with a simple leather thong, its supple texture glowing like burnished leather. The wooden slats of the bench creak softly in the stillness, as if sharing secrets of their own.

Mood and atmosphere: contemplative, soothing, introspective.

STYLE: Impressionist realism
COLORS: Warm earth tones (honey-brown, cedar-green), soft pastels (cerulean blue, golden yellow), rich browns (leather, wood grain), and touches of rust-red from the ferns.
