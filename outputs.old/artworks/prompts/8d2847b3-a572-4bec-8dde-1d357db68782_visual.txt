## Image Prompt
**Echoes in the Ashes**

Generate an atmospheric, black-and-white illustration with muted grays and deep shadows to evoke a sense of melancholy and despair. The composition features a silhouette of a figure (Zephyr) standing at the edge of a desolate wasteland, surrounded by a sea of ash and skeletal trees. The figure's body is twisted in a posture of anguish, as if the weight of their past is crushing them. In the background, a dark, foreboding sky with tendrils of smoke and ash stretches towards the horizon, casting long shadows across the landscape. The overall mood should be one of haunting desolation, conveying the themes of emotional pain, isolation, and the struggle to find solace in darkness.
