## Image Prompt
"Generate an eerie, dreamlike illustration of Zephyr the Silent standing at the edge of a desolate, dark landscape. The sky is a deep, foreboding indigo, with stars twinkling like cold, dead eyes. In the foreground, twisted, gnarled trees reach towards the sky, their branches grasping like skeletal fingers.

Zephyr stands in the center, shrouded in darkness, her features obscured by shadows. Her presence is hinted at, rather than seen, as if she's a whispered rumor or an unseen force. The air is heavy with an unsettling energy, and the atmosphere is thick with an otherworldly silence.

The color palette should be muted, with shades of dark grey, indigo, and sickle moonlight casting an eerie glow. The style should be hauntingly beautiful, like a painting by an unknown artist. Incorporate subtle hints of demonic presence, such as faint outlines or whispers in the wind."

## Negative Prompt
