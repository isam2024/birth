## Image Prompt
Generate an image of a fragmented, Gothic-style cityscape with crumbling stone walls and overgrown vegetation. A lone figure, shrouded in shadows, stands at the edge of a rooftop, gazing down at the ground below with a mix of despair and desperation. The figure's back is turned to the viewer, revealing a tattered cloak with frayed edges and a hint of dark, mystical symbols etched into the fabric.

In the foreground, a series of cracked, stone tiles form a broken, maze-like pattern, evoking a sense of disorientation and confusion. A faint, ethereal glow emanates from the cracks, casting an otherworldly light on the surrounding environment.

Soft, muted colors dominate the palette, with shades of grays, blues, and purples dominating the atmosphere. The lighting is dim and haunting, with long shadows stretching across the rooftop like skeletal fingers.

## Negative Prompt
text, words, letters, watermark, blurry
