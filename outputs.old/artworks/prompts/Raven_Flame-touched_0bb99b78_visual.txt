## Image Prompt
Title: Frayed Threads

Image Description:

A distressed, hand-painted portrait of a young woman's hands, suspended in mid-air against a backdrop of worn, gray stone walls. Her fingers are tangled and knotted, with threads of golden-brown fabric fraying from her fingertips like the unraveling of a torn tapestry. The colors are muted, with splashes of crimson and indigo bleeding through the cracks in the stone, casting an eerie glow on the scene. The woman's hands appear to be slowly coming apart at the seams, as if the very fabric of reality is being pulled from her grasp.
