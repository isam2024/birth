## Image Prompt
Generate an ethereal, dreamlike illustration that embodies the haunting themes and eerie beauty of "Fractured Light." The scene should depict a desolate, post-apocalyptic landscape with crumbling ruins and twisted metal debris scattered about. In the center, a lone figure stands amidst the destruction, shrouded in shadows. The atmosphere should be heavy with an otherworldly mist that permeates the air, casting an unsettling glow on the surroundings.

Colors: muted blues and greys, with hints of sickly green and orange. Soft, diffused light casts long shadows across the terrain, evoking a sense of unease.

Style: Use a mix of digital painting and textures to create a haunting, fragmented appearance, as if reality itself has been torn apart.

Composition: The figure should be placed in the center, with the ruins and debris spilling outwards from them like shattered glass.
