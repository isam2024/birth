## Image Prompt
I'd love to create a visual companion for "fragments of dissent"! Here's a detailed image generation prompt:

Generate an abstract, surreal landscape with crumbling cityscapes and fragmented architecture, echoing the dissonance in the text. The composition should feature muted, grayscale tones with splashes of fiery reds and oranges, symbolizing the quiet screams of discontent and resistance. Incorporate scattered, scattered ash-like fragments of paper or words on the ground, representing the lost beauty of truth. A lone, glowing light source should pierce through the grey haze, casting an eerie glow on the desolate landscape. Style it in a haunting, expressionist manner with bold brushstrokes, textured surfaces, and distorted forms, conveying the sense of unease and urgency that pervades the text.

## Negative Prompt
text, words, letters, watermark, blurry
