## Artistic Statement
"In 'Stillness in the Abyss', I aim to evoke a sense of profound calm amidst the turmoil of existence. The dark, undulating shapes seem to emanate from the depths of the void, inviting the viewer to surrender to their own inner stillness. By embracing the mystery and uncertainty that lies within, I hope to create a sense of connection with the unknown, and find solace in the quiet moments that lie between."

## Image Prompt
To generate 'Stillness in the Abyss', combine the following elements: a dark blue-grey color palette with subtle gradations of black and navy; a composition featuring a series of abstract, amorphous shapes undulating across the canvas like ripples on water; subject matter centered around the negative space between two central, void-like silhouettes, leaving the edges of the piece undefined; soft, ambient lighting that casts long shadows and creates an atmosphere of quiet contemplation; a photorealistic style blended with loose, expressive brushstrokes to capture the fluidity of the shapes and create a sense of depth; influenced by the works of Mark Rothko and the subtle abstraction of Joan Mitchell, but with an emphasis on negative space and ambiguity.

## Negative Prompt
blurry, low quality, text, watermark, signature
