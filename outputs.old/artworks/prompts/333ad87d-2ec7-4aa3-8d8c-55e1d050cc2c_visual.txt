## Image Prompt
"Fracture of the Gaze" Visual Companion:

The artwork depicts a fragmented mirror, shattered into a thousand pieces, each one reflecting a distorted version of reality. The mirror's surface is cracked and worn, with shards of glass overlapping like fractured emotions. In the center, a faint outline of a face can be seen, yet it remains elusive and undefined. Soft, ethereal lighting casts an otherworldly glow on the scene, evoking a sense of unease and disorientation.

Colors are muted and pastel, with shades of pale blue, mauve, and silver dominating the palette. The style is reminiscent of surrealist art, with intricate details and textures that invite close examination. In the background, subtle hints of cityscapes and architecture suggest the blurring of boundaries between reality and perception.
