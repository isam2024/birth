## Image Prompt
"Disintegrated Landscape"

A fragmented, abstracted map lies on a worn, wooden table. The top layer consists of faded, blue-gray terrain, with jagged fault lines and twisted tree roots etched into its surface. Beneath this, a series of charcoal drawings seem to seep from the wood itself, like ink bleeding through paper. A splintered, golden compass lies at the center, partially buried in the grayness. The surrounding cracks and fissures deepen into a rich, burnt sienna hue, suggesting aged stone or weathered steel. In one corner, a smudge of red paint muddies the otherwise uniform terrain.

## Negative Prompt
text, words, letters, watermark, blurry
