## Image Prompt
Image Prompt:

"A dimly lit, elliptical chamber is shrouded in an ethereal haze. Walls composed of cracked, iridescent glass refract and distort light, casting kaleidoscopic shadows across the floor. A lone, luminescent orb suspended from the ceiling pulsates with an otherworldly energy. The air is heavy with a sweet, noxious scent, as if decay and rebirth are inextricably linked. Shattered, crystalline formations line the walls, reflecting fragments of the surrounding environment. Flickering, crimson-red candles cast eerie silhouettes, imbuing the space with an aura of foreboding and unease."
