## Image Prompt
**Echo Chamber**

A stark, monochromatic photograph of a dimly lit room. The walls, floor, and ceiling are all identical shades of worn grey, blending into one another like wet ink on paper. A lone, flickering fluorescent light hangs above a single, metal chair, casting an eerie glow on the subject: a person seated in the chair, their face obscured by a hoodie or mask. The air is heavy with dust and the faint scent of decay. In the background, a series of old, peeling bookshelves stretch towards the ceiling, their spines cracked and worn, as if the words within have long since fallen silent.

## Negative Prompt
text, words, letters, watermark, blurry
