## Image Prompt
The scene unfolds like a shattered dreamscape, suspended between fragments of light and darkness. A lone figure stands at the edge of a cracked mirror, their reflection distorted and fractured, like shards of glass scattered across the floor. The air is heavy with an otherworldly silence, as if the very fabric of reality has been torn apart.

Soft, crimson hues bleed into the edges of the frame, like the gentle glow of embers. Burnt sienna undertones deepen the shadows, casting a sense of foreboding over the scene. Cerulean and azure wisps dance across the top, suggesting the whispers of the unknown that haunt the figure's mind.

The mirror's surface is rendered in shimmering silver-gray, like the sheen on a snake's skin. Its edges curve inward, like the lips of a scream, as if the very glass itself has been twisted and distorted by some unseen force.

In the center of the frame, the figure's gaze is lost to the void, their eyes vacant and unseeing. A delicate web of cracks and fissures weaves across their face, like the fine lines etched into a dried leaf.

The atmosphere is heavy with anticipation, as if the very act of looking will shatter the glass once more, releasing some hidden truth or unspeakable terror. The mood is one of unsettling unease, like standing at the threshold of an abyssal void that yawns open beneath your feet.
