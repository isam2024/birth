## Image Prompt
The image depicts a serene and contemplative landscape, set against a backdrop of soft, golden light that filters through a veil of wispy clouds. The scene unfolds in the stillness of a forgotten garden, where a majestic cypress tree stands tall, its rugged trunk worn by time and weathered to a deep, burnished brown.

The foreground is dominated by a gentle, swirling mist that dances around the base of the tree, imbuing the air with an ethereal quality. The colors are muted yet vibrant, with hues of cerulean blue and emerald green evoking the promise of new life. Crisp, burnt sienna tones add warmth to the scene, infusing the atmosphere with a sense of earthy authenticity.

The mist is reflected in the tranquil waters of a small pond, where lily pads float like delicate white petals, their surfaces etched with subtle ripples that suggest the quiet movement of unseen life. The air is heavy with the scent of damp soil and decaying leaves, casting a soothing melancholy over the entire scene.

The overall mood is one of reverent stillness, as if time itself has been suspended in a state of perpetual pause. The atmosphere is characterized by an unsettling sense of impermanence, where delicate beauty hangs precariously in the balance.

STYLE: Expressionist Realism
COLORS: Burnt sienna, cerulean blue, emerald green, creamy whites, and weathered grays
