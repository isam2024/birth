## Image Prompt
In the heart of a serene lake, a delicate, lace-like tendril of smoke rises from a wispy cluster of ashes, like a gentle finger pointing towards the sky. The scene unfolds cinematically, with the tender, almost translucent petals of a forgotten summer unfolding like memories on the shore. Soft, ethereal hues of cerulean and misty blue dominate the landscape, imbuing the atmosphere with an otherworldly tranquility.

As the eye travels along the lake's tranquil surface, fragments of crimson and burnt sienna emerge from beneath the rippling water, evoking the memory of ancient stones weathered by time. The light casts a warm, golden glow across the scene, as if infused by the first tender rays of dawn breaking over the horizon.

The gentle lapping of the lake's waters against the shore creates a soothing melody, punctuated by the occasional ripple and disturbance on the surface. In the foreground, delicate brushstrokes of pale peach and ivory blend with wispy strands of cloud, creating an ephemeral veil that veils the scene in mystery.

A scattering of scattered leaves and twigs adds a sense of decay and abandonment to the composition, as if nature itself were embracing the fading memory of love. In this fleeting moment, time stands still, and all that remains is the gentle, whispering breeze carrying the last remnants of a long-forgotten summer's kiss.
