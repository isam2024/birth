## Image Prompt
I'd be delighted to create a visual companion for "Whispers in the Sand." Here's a detailed image generation prompt:

"Create an ethereal illustration that captures the essence of 'Whispers in the Sand.' The scene is set at dusk in a vast, arid desert landscape. Soft, warm hues of orange and pink dominate the sky, with wispy clouds streaked across the horizon. In the foreground, a lone figure (approximating the artist's pose) stands amidst swirling sand dunes, their features obscured by the veil of dust. The air is filled with delicate, ghostly silhouettes of palm trees, while tendrils of wind-whispered secrets appear to emanate from the sand itself, as if echoes of distant memories. Use a blend of digital painting and watercolor techniques to achieve a dreamy, otherworldly atmosphere."

## Negative Prompt
text, words, letters, watermark, blurry
