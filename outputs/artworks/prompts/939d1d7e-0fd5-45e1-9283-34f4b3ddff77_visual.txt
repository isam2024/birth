## Image Prompt
Generate an image inspired by "whispers of stillness" with the following specifications:

Create a minimalist, dreamy landscape depicting an oasis at dusk. The scene should feature a serene desert landscape with a lone palm tree standing tall in the center, its branches stretching towards the sky like a gentle embrace. In the background, a soft gradient of warm hues (orange, pink, and purple) blends seamlessly into the night sky, evoking a sense of tranquility.

Use subtle textures to convey the stillness, such as fine grain sand, delicate reed patterns, and leafy branches. Incorporate the phrase "the wind whispers low" in a curved line above the palm tree, using a soft, ethereal font that blends with the surrounding environment. The overall atmosphere should be one of peaceful contemplation, inviting the viewer to step into the stillness of the oasis.

## Negative Prompt
