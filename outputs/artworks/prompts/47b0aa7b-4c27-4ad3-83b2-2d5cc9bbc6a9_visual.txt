## Image Prompt
Generate an eerie, surreal landscape with twisted, organic forms that evoke a sense of despair and desperation. The sky is a deep, foreboding crimson, with thick, grey clouds that seem to writhe and twist like living tendrils. In the foreground, a figure lies broken and still, surrounded by scattered, charred remains of what once was. The air is heavy with smoke and ash, casting a sickly yellow glow over the desolate scene. Incorporate distorted, abstract shapes that seem to pulse with a malevolent energy, as if the very soul itself is in torment. Use muted, earthy tones and deliberate brushstrokes to convey a sense of unease and dread.

## Negative Prompt
text, words, letters, watermark, blurry
