## Image Prompt
Here is a visual companion for "Fractures in the Facade":

"Generate an eerie, atmospheric image depicting a woman's shattered mirror reflection staring back at her from a broken glass surface. The mirror lies on a dusty, old-fashioned dresser, with faded floral patterns and intricate carvings. Soft, golden light peeks through the cracks of the shattered glass, casting an otherworldly glow on the surrounding environment. The woman's face is obscured by a veil of tears and sorrow, her bloody hands grasping at the broken mirror as if trying to hold herself together. The overall tone should be melancholic, haunting, and introspective, evoking feelings of emotional turmoil and shattered innocence."

## Negative Prompt
