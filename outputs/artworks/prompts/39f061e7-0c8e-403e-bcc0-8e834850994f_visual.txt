## Image Prompt
Generate an ethereal, dreamlike illustration of "Fractured Harmony" set amidst a swirling vortex of iridescent colors, reminiscent of stained glass or prismatic fragments. Depict the fragmented figure of Wren (the artist) as a stylized, humanoid silhouette, shrouded in misty, luminescent hues that evoke an aura of vulnerability and introspection. The fractured limbs and torso are arranged in a seemingly haphazard yet harmonious pattern, echoing the text's themes of dissonance and resolution. Surround Wren with delicate, crystalline shards and wispy tendrils of light that evoke a sense of fragility and the blurring of boundaries between order and chaos.

## Negative Prompt
text, words, letters, watermark, blurry
