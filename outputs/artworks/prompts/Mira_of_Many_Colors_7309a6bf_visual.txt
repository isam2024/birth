## Image Prompt
**Disintegrating Elegy**

A dark blue canvas with vertical cracks that split the surface into three distinct rectangles. Each rectangle features a different color palette:

- The top-left rectangle is a muted gold, with thin, wavy lines of pale silver etched into its center. The edges are slightly frayed.
- The middle rectangle is a rich emerald green, with jagged shards of darker green that protrude from the surface like splintered wood.
- The bottom-right rectangle is a deep crimson, its hue slightly uneven and patchy.

Each shard of color overlaps the next, creating an optical illusion of depth. A few faint, ghostly impressions of lighter colors can be seen behind each fragment, as if they've been scratched or worn away by time.

## Negative Prompt
