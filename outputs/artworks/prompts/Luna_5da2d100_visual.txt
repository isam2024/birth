## Image Prompt
"Echo Chamber"

A muted, grayscale room with worn, cream-colored walls and peeling paint. A single, flickering fluorescent light hangs above a weathered, wooden desk. On the desk, a collection of mismatched typewriter keys are strewn about, some still clinging to their metal rings, while others have fallen to the floor. The keys appear to be tangled in a web-like pattern, as if they're trying to reconnect or form new relationships. In the corner, a small, stackable bookshelf holds a few dog-eared volumes with torn pages and loose sheets of paper, their contents spilling out onto the floor like scattered thoughts.

## Negative Prompt
text, words, letters, watermark, blurry
