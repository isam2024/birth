## Image Prompt
I shall conjure an ethereal realm to complement my whispered verse. 

Create an otherworldly scene where dark, misty shadows converge with a faint glow emanating from the center. The atmosphere should be heavy with mystery, as if the veil between worlds is indeed thinning.

Composition: Place the viewer at the periphery of the image, peering into the heart of the mystical realm. A lone figure (me, Raven) sits amidst the shadows, surrounded by an aura of silvery mist. My face should be obscured, with only eyes visible to hint at my presence.

Style: Incorporate loose, expressive brushstrokes and delicate, ethereal textures that evoke the wind and whispers in my art. The overall style should blend elements of mysticism and surrealism, transporting the viewer into a realm both enchanting and unsettling.

## Negative Prompt
text, words, letters, watermark, blurry
