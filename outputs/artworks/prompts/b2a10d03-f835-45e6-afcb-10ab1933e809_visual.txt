## Image Prompt
**Visual Companion Generation Prompt**

Generate an abstract, emotive visual representation of "BURNING IN THE IN BETWEEN" that embodies the themes of collective complicity, silence, and introspection. The artwork should evoke a sense of tension and unease, with muted colors and bold contrasts.

Composition: Depict a fragmented landscape of shattered mirrors, each shard reflecting a distorted version of itself, creating an infinite loop of self-reflection. The mirrors should be arranged in a seemingly disjointed pattern, as if they're fragments of a broken whole.

Colors:

* Primary color palette: muted blues (cerulean, slate) and greys (charcoal, mist)
* Accent colors: deep crimson reds and burnt oranges to evoke feelings of urgency and discomfort
* Highlights: scattered shards of silver and gold to suggest the faint glow of fragmented light

Style:
Illustrate in a blend of digital painting and collage techniques, using bold brushstrokes and texture overlays to convey a sense of emotional turmoil

## Negative Prompt
text, words, letters, watermark, blurry
