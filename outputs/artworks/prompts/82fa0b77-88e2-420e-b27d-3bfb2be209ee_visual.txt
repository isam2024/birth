## Image Prompt
"Generate an eerie, atmospheric illustration that embodies the sense of being lost in the void. Depict a dimly lit, abandoned chamber with crumbling stone walls and a low ceiling, hinting at a long-forgotten history. The dominant color palette should be a muted blend of blues and greys, evoking a feeling of desolation and despair. Incorporate subtle, swirling shadows to create an unsettling sense of movement within the space.

At the center of the image, incorporate a faint, glowing light source - perhaps a lone candle or a flickering flame - casting an ethereal glow on the walls. Include scattered, fragmented objects and whispers of forgotten knowledge etched into the stone. Style should blend traditional mediums with digital textures to convey a sense of age and decay."

## Negative Prompt
text, words, letters, watermark, blurry
