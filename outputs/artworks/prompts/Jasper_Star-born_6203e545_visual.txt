## Image Prompt
" Desert Pool at Dusk"

A solitary pool of water lies in the center of the desert floor, reflecting the fading light of day. The surrounding terrain is a warm beige, with rocky outcroppings and scrubby desert plants stretching towards the sky. In the distance, a lone mesquite tree stands sentinel, its branches etched against the vibrant hues of the desert sky: soft pinks, oranges, and purples bleed into twilight. Water's edge is fringed with delicate, feathery reeds that sway gently in the breeze. The pool's surface is dotted with subtle ripples, as if a small fish has recently broken the stillness.
