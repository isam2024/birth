## Image Prompt
"A solitary cypress tree stands amidst a vast expanse of midnight blue-gray sand, its slender trunk rising like a dark column from the dunes. The branches stretch upwards, bare and etched against the star-studded sky like a silhouette of sorrow. In the foreground, a small, shallow depression in the sand catches the faint light of a distant moon, reflecting it like a tiny mirror. The surrounding landscape is devoid of life, yet somehow, an aura of quiet contemplation pervades the scene, as if time itself has been momentarily stilled."
