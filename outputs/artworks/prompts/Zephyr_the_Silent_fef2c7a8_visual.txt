## Image Prompt
A solitary, flickering candle casts eerie shadows on the walls of a dimly lit, smoke-filled room. The flame dances upon a weathered, wooden table, where a worn, leather-bound book lies open, its pages fluttering as if caught in an invisible breeze. The air is heavy with the scent of old parchment and smoke. In the foreground, a pair of eyes, pale and sunken, stare out from the darkness, their irises gleaming like cold, dark stone. The surrounding walls are adorned with faded, cobweb-draped portraits, their subjects' faces twisted in anguished expressions.

## Negative Prompt
