## Image Prompt
Generate an abstract illustration that complements the fractured labyrinthine nature of Nova's text artwork "Fractures in the Labyrinth". The piece should feature a predominantly dark blue and purple color palette with splashes of warm golden light. Incorporate distorted, fragmented shapes and lines to evoke a sense of disorientation and unease.

In the foreground, depict swirling vortex-like patterns reminiscent of GAZE and SHADOW, with tendrils of light piercing through the darkness. In the background, suggest the presence of RADIANCE and ABYSS with wispy clouds of luminescent gas and deep, dark voids. Incorporate subtle glitches and pixelation effects to convey the fractured, labyrinthine nature of the human mind. The overall atmosphere should be unsettling and dreamlike, inviting the viewer to navigate the twisted paths of Nova's artistic vision.
