On the right, a fiery orange-red color scheme ignites, symbolizing resistance and defiance. Flames dance around the central axis, as if fueled by the passionate voices of those silenced. The atmosphere is tense and energetic, with bold brushstrokes and textures conveying a sense of urgency and determination. Incorporate subtle hints of ancient, mystical symbols and patterns to add depth to the artwork.
