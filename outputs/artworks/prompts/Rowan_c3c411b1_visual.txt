## Image Prompt
Image Prompt:

"A crumbling stone pedestal stands alone on a windswept beach, its surface etched with the faint outlines of forgotten hieroglyphs. The pedestal's edges are weathered to mossy green, blending seamlessly into the sea-eroded rocks surrounding it. A single feather lies at the pedestal's base, its delicate curves stark against the dark grey sand. In the distance, a desolate, crumbling lighthouse pierces the smoky horizon, its light source obscured by a shroud of wispy cirrus clouds. The sky above is a deep, foreboding indigo, with hints of bruised purple at the edges."
