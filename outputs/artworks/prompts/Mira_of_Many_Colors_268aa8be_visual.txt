## Image Prompt
Title: Dissonant Frequencies

A large, darkened room is illuminated by a single flickering fluorescent tube overhead. The walls are painted a deep, rich red, while the floor is covered in a mosaic of shattered mirrors. Each shard reflects a different image: a cityscape at dusk, a close-up of a human face, a fragment of a broken tree. In the center of the room, a lone chair sits atop a raised dais, its seat and backrest constructed from interconnected, pulsing wires. The air is thick with the scent of ozone and burning plastic.

 Colors: Dark red, flickering fluorescent light, copper wires, shattered glass in shades of blue and clear.

Composition: The fractured mirrors and shards are arranged in a seemingly haphazard pattern, yet upon closer inspection, reveal a deliberate geometry. The chair, constructed from wires, appears both organic and synthetic.

Style: Surrealism with industrial undertones
