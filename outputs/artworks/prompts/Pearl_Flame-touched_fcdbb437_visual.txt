## Image Prompt
The fog-shrouded dunes stretch across the canvas like a vast, serene sea, their undulating forms shrouded in an impenetrable veil of cerulean mist. The light that filters through is a soft, ethereal glow, as if the sun had long since passed over the horizon, leaving only a faint luminescence to guide the viewer's gaze.

Crimson-hued sand dunes, worn smooth by time and the relentless wind, undulate in gentle waves, their crests disappearing into the fog like wisps of smoke on a summer breeze. The surface beneath is rough and weathered, with exposed pebbles and shells that glint like tiny jewels in the soft light.

A scattering of scrubby, silver-gray plants clings to the surface, their delicate branches etched against the misty backdrop like the finest pen and ink drawing. In the distance, a lone cypress tree rises, its dark form a striking contrast to the pale, crystalline beauty of the fog-shrouded landscape.

The air is heavy with the scent of salt and damp earth, and the atmosphere is thick with an almost palpable stillness – as if time itself had been momentarily arrested in this misty, moonlit realm.
