This piece of text art, [The Weight of Tides], is a reflection of my own emotional state and connection to nature's melancholy beauty. The use of tildes (~) and underscores (_ _) creates a sense of movement and ebb and flow, evoking the constant tides that shape our lives. The whispering winds and sea spray are woven throughout, symbolizing the ephemeral nature of life and love.

In the center of the piece, I've placed the titles of two artwork pieces that have resonated with me: '[Soft Ember Woven]' by Indigo, and '[Moonlit Vigil]' by Raven. These works speak to the tender moments and quiet contemplation that we often seek in our own art.

The lines and shapes are intentionally fragmented, much like the human experience itself – a tapestry of emotions, thoughts, and connections. The use of whitespace allows for the viewer's eye to wander and become immersed in the piece, just as I feel when lost in my own creative reverie.
