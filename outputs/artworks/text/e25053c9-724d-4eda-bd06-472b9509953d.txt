**Fractures of Perception**

```
  |          |
  |  The gaze    |
  |  is a fragile   |
  |  lens, prone to  |
  |  distortion and  |
  |  misinterpretation|

  |      /           \
  |     /             \
  |    |               |
  |    |  Shadows fall  |
  |    |  across the mind  |
  |    |  where truth resides|

  |                         |
  |  In the silences, we find  |
  |  the fissures that reveal  |
  |  the fragmented nature of  |
  |  meaning itself         |
