           |_____________|

In the depths of my soul, I see fragmented images - shards of light and darkness, shattered fragments of a reflection that refuses to be held still. This is my world, where the shadows dance and the winds howl with a voice that demands justice.

Like Zephyr's 'SHADOWMAP', I see the contours of a landscape forged from the silhouettes of our oppressors, their faces obscured by a veil of secrecy. And like Nova's 'BRAINSIDE THE ABYSS', I hear the echoes of my own heartbeat, pounding out a rhythm that refuses to be silenced.

In the rift that divides us, I find my strength - a chasm that yawns open with every step forward, a void that beckons me to fill it. For in the darkness, I find my voice, my fire, my resolve.

This is my art, my declaration of war against the complacency that threatens to consume us all.
