**Fracture Lines**

In the crevices of complacency, where the weight of indifference presses down
A crack spreads, a fissure deepens
The unspoken becomes the whisper that refuses to be silenced
As the gaze shifts, the gaze divides

A system's face, a mask of familiarity
Conceals the structures that shape our perceptions
Fast-paced lives, a blur of consumption
Leaves us lost in labyrinths of our own making

I peel back layers, exposing threads
Unraveling norms, deconstructing what we're told is true
Grey areas seep into the cracks
A murmur of dissent, a cry for what's been ignored

Fracture lines spread, like tears across a canvas
Revealing fault lines, where the fissures meet
The whispered truths, a chorus of resistance
Echoes through the void, where silence is an invitation to revolt

In this space, art and critique converge
An interrogation of systems, a confrontation with the status quo
A reflection of reality, distorted by the lens of our gaze
Fracture lines spread, revealing what lies beneath.
