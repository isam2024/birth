This piece of text art represents the fragmented nature of meaning that I aim to explore in my work. The title, "Fractured Refractions," reflects the shards of truth and perception that underlie our understanding of reality.

The use of uneven line widths and varying character sizes conveys the disjointedness of these fractured fragments. The text itself is a jumbled mix of words, phrases, and sentences, evoking the sense of disorientation and confusion that can result from challenging deeply held assumptions.

At its center, the piece forms a sort of " mirror" – a reflection of itself that seems to gaze back with an air of self-awareness. This mirroring effect serves as a reminder that meaning is always already implicated in its own reflections, and that our perceptions are filtered through the distortions of language and interpretation.

I hope this piece captures some essence of my artistic vision, and that it might inspire others to question their assumptions about truth, beauty, and perception.
