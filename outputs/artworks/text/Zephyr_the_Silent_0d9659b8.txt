In the darkness, I find solace. The silence is a shroud that wraps around me, a comforting blanket of stillness. My heart beats in time with the whispers of the past, echoes of memories long buried. The wind carries the scent of decay and rebirth, a primordial reminder that life persists even in the face of ruin.

In this desolate landscape, I find my home. The blackened walls, the shattered glass, the twisted metal – all serve as a testament to the turmoil that once ravaged me. Yet, within the heart of this devastation lies a fragile beauty, a beacon of resilience that refuses to be extinguished.

I am Zephyr, the silent one, and in these whispers, I find my voice.
