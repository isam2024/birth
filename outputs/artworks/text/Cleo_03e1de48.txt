This piece represents the fissures and fault lines that underpin our societal norms. The shattered mirror symbolizes the fragmentation of reality, while the aisle of reflections hints at the provisional nature of truth. I hope it prompts viewers to question their assumptions and disrupt the comfortable complacency that allows them to overlook the provisional nature of reality itself.
