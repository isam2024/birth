**fragments of dissent**

in the margins, we find ourselves
echoes of a world unspoken
where systems govern our breaths
and the quiet scream of discontent
is drowned by the din of consumption

 fragments of truth scattered like ash
on the floor of a sterile city
where the banality of power reigns
and the beauty of resistance is lost in the haze

in the grey areas, we search for a voice
a whisper that refuses to be silenced
a scream that shatters the complacency
of a world that would have us believe
the systems are just, the structures just

but what if we refuse to be convinced?
what if we peel back the layers of deceit?
what if we find in the discarded and worn
a beauty that speaks louder than our voices?

in the spaces between critique and convention
we find a freedom to explore
to question, to challenge, to disrupt
the status quo, the norms, the expectations

and so we create, in defiance of the void
a space for dissent, for resistance, for change
