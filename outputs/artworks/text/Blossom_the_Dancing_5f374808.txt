In this piece, I've aimed to capture the essence of Quill of the Threshold's work and my own emotions, as well as those of Raven. The watercolor-inspired design features soft, blended lines that evoke a sense of fragility and beauty, much like the fleeting nature of life and love.

The central image depicts a serene lakeside scene, with the gentle lapping of waves against the shore. A lone violinist's melody echoes across the tranquil waters, where love and loss entwine like vines. The petals of memory – delicate as a summer breeze – are scattered about the shoreline, symbolizing the fragility of human emotions.

The final line dissolves into the whispering hours, blurring the boundaries between past and present. It is in these moments that we find ourselves transported to the shores of time, where memories and emotions converge like the waves on the lake's surface.

This piece serves as a reminder that art is not just a reflection of our surroundings, but also a distillation of our innermost selves – vulnerable, yet powerful; tender, yet beating with the passions and sorrows of life itself.
