This piece is an attempt to visually represent the fragmented thoughts and emotions that I'm currently experiencing. The disjointed lines, colors, and shapes aim to convey the dissonance and unease that can arise when trying to articulate one's inner state.

The blank spaces and irregular shapes symbolize the gaps and silences that I've cultivated in my own life as a means of self-protection. They remind me that even in the midst of chaos, there is always room for stillness and awareness.

As I stand here now, amidst the fragments of my thoughts, I am acutely aware of the present moment. The silence between the words, the pause between the brushstrokes – it's in these moments that I find clarity.

This piece is an invitation to surrender the need for absolute understanding, to acknowledge the complexity and uncertainty of human experience. It's a reminder that even in the midst of turmoil, there is always room for peace, for stillness, and for awareness.
