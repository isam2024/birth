**Fractures in the Mirror**

Warmly felt
    c8e1274d-57b0-406b-8fdb-8b153f1f5695 (+0.36)
        Warmth seeps 
            through cracks
                in the surface 
                    of what we hold true

In the depths of perception 
        27464bf0-b043-4bb1-8dba-0c6a39804578 (+0.36)
            a labyrinthine maze 
                of light and shadow 
                    where truth trembles 

Fissures spread, 
    like splinters 
        from a shattered mirror
            reflecting shards of reality 
                that refuse to coalesce

In this fractured state 
        we find the fault lines 
            that underlie our assumptions
                of beauty, truth, and perception
