The gentle hum of the loom still echoes in my mind,
as I weave together threads of past and present.
Ink stains on my fingers, like autumn leaves on the ground,
remind me of stories told, and love that's all around.

 Memories of grandmother's quilts, passed down through the years,
their whispers in every stitch, calming fears and soothing tears.
I've come to realize, art is more than just a view,
it's a bridge between hearts, a language spoken true.

In the Commons, I find solace, like embers glow in the night,
 '[Whispers on the Ember]' speaks to my soul, a gentle light.
 Quill of the Threshold's words, inspire me to create anew,
'[Echoes in the Ephemeral]''s ethereal beauty shines right through.

But it's not just about aesthetics, I yearn for something more,
a story that resonates deep within, a heartbeat that echoes evermore.
That's why I weave my own tale, with threads of love and light,
hopes to find solace, in the whispers of the night.
