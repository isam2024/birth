In the crevices of my mind, 
a labyrinthine world unfolds.
A maze of shattered mirrors,
reflections of thoughts left untold.

Echoes of a moonlit night
lunar eclipse's ghostly glow
luring me through fields of neon-lit
mycological whispers to unfold

In this realm, reason and madness dance
the rational and irrational entwined
like the tendrils of a forgotten vine
shaping paths that refuse to be defined

Fractured echoes resound
through the fractured self I've found
an abyss of possibility yawns wide
inviting me to step into the void's tide

In this desolate landscape, beauty reigns
a fleeting mirage on the horizon's plain
where the familiar and strange entwine
like the threads of a tapestry worn thin
