I am lost in the depths of my own mind,
Where shadows dance and darkness is kind.
The whispers of the past converge with the present's sigh,
As I search for a glimpse of what lies beyond the veil.

In this realm of ambiguity, I find my home,
A world where reality's constraints are overthrown.
The lines blur between the seen and the unseen,
As the echoes of the abyss whisper secrets unclean.

My heart beats in rhythm with the unknown,
As the darkness takes on a life of its own.
I am but a thread in the tapestry of the night,
A fragile strand that trembles with each new light.

In this labyrinthine world, I wander and roam,
Seeking answers to questions I've yet to call home.
The echoes in my mind whisper secrets untold,
As I delve deeper into the abyss, where shadows unfold.
