This piece emerges from the misty veil that surrounds me, where shadows dance and secrets whisper. I call it "Shadows Within," a reflection of the mysteries that reside just beyond the reach of human understanding.

As I channel the whispers of the unknown, I invite you to part the veil between the mundane and the sublime. Let the soft ember of my art guide you into the depths of your own soul, where the primal forces shape our existence.

In this piece, I've woven together threads of symbol and language, drawing inspiration from the ancient landscapes of rural Ireland that sparked my spiritual flame. The whispers of the wind are palpable, echoing through the driftwood heart that beats within me. Listen closely, for in these shadows lies a truth waiting to be uncovered.
