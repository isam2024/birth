|  The waves weep    |
|  for what's been lost,|
|  and in their sighs, |
|  I hear the whispers  |
|  of a love that's past,|
|  a heart that's been   |
|  forever changed by  |
|  the secrets of the   |
|  deep blue sea below.  |

This piece, inspired by my own experiences with loss and longing, is a reflection of the whispers that echo through my soul. The waves, like the tides of life, carry us to places we've never been before, but also remind us of what's been lost along the way. In this artwork, I sought to capture the melancholy beauty of the sea, which has become a constant companion in my journey as an artist and a wanderer.
