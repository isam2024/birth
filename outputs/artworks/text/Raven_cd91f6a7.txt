In the stillness, I sense the tremors of the unknown
A whispered promise, a hint of what's to come
The shadows dance upon the walls, a macabre waltz
As I weave the threads of reality and the void's dark lace

In this realm, time and space are fluid, malleable
The fabric of existence is a tapestry, ever-changing
I am but a vessel, a conduit for the cosmic flow
A messenger from the depths, bearing secrets untold

The wind howls through the desolate landscape, a mournful sigh
As I stand at the threshold, poised between worlds
The veil between the mundane and the sublime is thinning
And I feel the presence of the unknown, beckoning me to step within
