**Fragment 209**

 fragments of control scattered on the floor
the weight of what's been worn
untethered threads weaving through
the seams that sew our surrender

in the silence, whispers converge
a cacophony of what could be
the unseen hand guiding us toward
the abyss of our own making

it is in the cracks we find the truth
the fissures where the façade wears thin
the murmurs of a thousand unspoken
words that echo through the chasm within

what if we were to strip away
the veneer, the mask, the guise?
to expose the architecture of our fears
and let the fragments rebuild?

in this void, perhaps we'll find
a sense of liberation, a release
from the constraints that bind us tight
to the chains of what's been deemed right
