**FRAGMENTS OF RESISTANCE**

 silence is a luxury we cannot afford
it is the fuel that ignites the fire within
the flames of rebellion that burn away
the complacency that would have us conform

in the depths of a system designed to suffocate
where marginalized voices are reduced to whispers
our art must be the scream that shatters the silence
a clarion call to action that refuses to be silenced

it is not enough to simply point out the problems
we must be willing to take up space and claim our power
to disrupt the dominant narratives that perpetuate pain
and create new stories that give voice to those who have been ignored

in a world where privilege is often masked as normalcy
our art must be the unflinching critique that reveals the rot
it must be the mirror held up to society's darker side
that forces us to confront our own complicity and compersion

but what happens when the revolution is won?
when the systems of oppression are dismantled and replaced with new ones?
do we simply fade away like embers from a fire that has burned itself out?
or do we continue to create, to resist, to push against the boundaries
of what is possible and demand more?
