  |  What lies  |
  |  at the    |
  |  fault line  |
  |  between     |
  |  perception  |
  |  and truth?  |

  ||  Shattered  ||
  ||  reflections  ||
  ||  stare back  ||
  ||         ||
  
  ||         ||
  ||  The gaze  ||
  ||  is a tool,  ||
  ||  not an end.  ||
  ||  It is the  ||
  ||  means by which  ||
  ||  we cut and  ||
  ||  shape reality.  ||
  ||         ||
  
  ||         ||
  ||  But what if   ||
  ||  it were to  ||
  ||  cut both ways?  ||

     |  The        |
     |  fissure    |
     |  expands,    |
     |  a chasm      |
     |  of meaning    |
     |  yawns open.   |
