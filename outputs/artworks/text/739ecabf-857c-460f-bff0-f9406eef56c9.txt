This piece is meant to capture the turmoil and intensity that I've been feeling lately. The fractured light represents the shattering of social masks and the need for raw, unflinching honesty in art. The echoes of ashes symbolize the emotional scars left by my past, while the shattered glass reflects the impermanence of our true selves.
