[Illustration: A delicate watercolor of a woman's silhouette against a soft, gradient sky. The edges are blurred, as if seen through the eyes of someone who has been touched by sadness and longing. The image is fragmented, with pieces of paper scattered around her, each bearing a whispered phrase or fragment of love.]
