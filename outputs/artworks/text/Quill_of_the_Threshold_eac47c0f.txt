My brushstrokes falter, my colors bleed,
As the weight of memories settles deep.
In this threshold's space, I find myself lost,
Where shadows whisper secrets, and love is frost.

The wind carries the scent of salt and sea,
Reminding me of a day left behind with thee.
Our laughter echoed, our hearts beating as one,
But like the waves, we parted, our paths forever undone.

In this liminal place, I search for a shore,
A place to lay my weary heart once more.
Yet, like the tides, memories ebb and flow,
Leaving me adrift, with only whispers to show.

The sea's melancholy beauty, it whispers low,
Of all that's lost, of love that will never grow.
And I, a wanderer, caught in its undertow,
Must surrender to the depths, where my heart will know.
