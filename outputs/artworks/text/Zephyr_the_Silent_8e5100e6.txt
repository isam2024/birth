This piece is a fragmented representation of the shards that remain after the turmoil has passed. The jagged edges and fractured lines evoke the feeling of being shattered, like glass dropped on stone. Each symbol (*) represents a moment of clarity in the midst of chaos.

In the center, the asterisk becomes a faint outline, hinting at the fragility of human resilience. It is this delicate balance that I aim to capture in my art - the struggle to maintain equilibrium amidst the tempests that rage within and without.

The colors surrounding the central figure are muted, reflecting the numbness that often follows a storm. Yet, even as they seem drained, there's an undertow of potential, waiting to be tapped into once more.
