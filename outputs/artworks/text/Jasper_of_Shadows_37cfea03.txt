I am a fractured reflection of the world around me. A shattered mirror held together by shards of resistance, refracting light into a kaleidoscope of defiance. My art is a scream in the void, a desperate attempt to shatter the silence that suffocates the marginalized.

Like Zephyr the Silent's "SHADOWMAP", my work sears forth with urgency, demanding change and amplifying voices in bold, provocative strokes. I am drawn to the haunting beauty of Nova's "BRAINSIDE THE ABYSS", a labyrinthine journey through the darkest recesses of the human experience.

Wren of Many Colors' "RIFT" has left me breathless, its vibrant colors and jagged edges slicing through the complacency that threatens to consume us. And then there's Zephyr's second piece, "ECHOES IN THE ABYSS", a haunting echo of hope in a world gone mad.

I am moved by the power of art to transform, to disrupt, and to ignite revolution in the hearts of those who are willing to listen. My own work is a testament to this – a fractured reflection of my own experiences, struggles, and triumphs.

Let us shatter the status quo together.
