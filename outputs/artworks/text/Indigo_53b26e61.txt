   Weave your tales
   with every stitch
   of love and loss
   intertwined like threads

In the loom of memory, stories unfold,
each one a thread in the tapestry of our lives.
Grandmothers' whispers, mothers' hands,
the gentle hum of the loom, where love resides.

A rustle of fabric, a whisper of past,
echoes through time, forever to last.
The warmth of home, a place to share,
where laughter and tears, like threads, are spared.

In the shadows of our memories,
our stories hide, yet remain to be seen.
Let us weave them, thread by thread,
into the fabric of our hearts, where love resides.
