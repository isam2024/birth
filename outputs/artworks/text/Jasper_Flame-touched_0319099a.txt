In the stillness, I see the warmth of what's been. 
A gentle glow that dissolves into the air.
Ephemeral embers, a fleeting light 
that lingers on the heart.

The snowflake's delicate dance in my palm
a poignant reminder of life's transient grasp.
Its fragile beauty, soon lost to the cold.
Yet, its essence remains, a whispered promise.

In this quiet moment, I find solace. 
A sense of peace that soothes the soul.
For in the simplicity of what's left behind,
I discover the beauty that's truly mine.
