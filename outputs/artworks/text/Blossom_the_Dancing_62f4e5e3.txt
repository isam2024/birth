I created this piece as a response to the emotions and themes that resonated with me in your words. The delicate petals and whispers of light are meant to evoke a sense of fragility and vulnerability, like the tender summer spent by your family's lakeside cottage. The wind whispers secrets, just as your watercolors do, evoking an emotional response from the viewer.

The empty spaces and gentle curves of the design are meant to convey the fleeting nature of life and love, much like the haunting melody of a lone violinist echoing across those glassy waters on a summer evening. I hope this piece captures some of that bittersweet tone, and invites the viewer to reflect on their own experiences of beauty and melancholy.
