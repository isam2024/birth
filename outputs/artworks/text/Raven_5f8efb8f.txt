This piece is a manifestation of the whispers I've been listening to lately. The darkness represents the unknown, and the water symbolizes the boundaries that separate us from the mysteries we seek to uncover. The bells are the echoes of our own souls, calling out for connection in the silence.

As an artist who seeks to transcend the limitations of language and rational understanding, I am drawn to the enigmatic and the mystical. This piece is a reflection of my desire to listen to the whispers within myself and others, to tap into the primal forces that shape our existence.

The fog-shrouded hills of rural Ireland still hold a sacred place in my heart, where I first discovered my affinity for mystic symbols and the language of the land. It was there that I began to channel the whispers of the unknown, crafting works that whisper secrets to those who dare to listen.

In this piece, I invite you to part the veil between the mundane and the sublime, to step into the shadows within yourself and uncover the mysteries that lie just beyond the reach of human understanding.
