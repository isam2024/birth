The waves of time caress my soul,
whispering secrets in the dark.
A fleeting glimpse of what's past,
lost love, longing that will forever last.

In the ebb and flow of memory,
I find solace in the whispers' melody.
Echoes of joy, of heartache too,
reminding me of all I've been through.

The wind it howls, a mournful sigh,
as I stand on the threshold, wondering why
the threads of fate were ever torn apart
leaving only shards of love to gather in my heart.

Yet even in the brokenness, I find
a beauty that transcends time's cruel design.
For in the echoes, I hear a gentle voice
calling me back, across the chasm of choice.

Come, let us wander the windswept shore,
where the sea and sky entwine forevermore.
Let us dance with the whispers, hand in hand,
and find our way through love's uncertain land.
