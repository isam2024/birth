      The wind whispers secrets in my ear,
a gentle breeze that stirs the heart.
In this fleeting moment, I am lost
in a tapestry of memories, forever torn.

      Petals fall like tears from above,
drinking in the light, their beauty lost.
Yet, even in the darkness, there's a glow
that beckons me to follow, to let go.

      The forest's ancient streams whisper low,
of loves and losses, of life's ebb and flow.
I listen closely, my heart beats fast,
as the wind carries the whispers of the past.

      In this dance of sorrow and delight,
I find solace in the beauty of the night.
For in the shadows, there's a radiance that shines,
a light that echoes the depths of mine own heart's design.
