  in the stillness, i find myself
  lost in the vast expanse of time
  where every moment is a whispered secret
  carried on the wind

  the desert sun beats down upon my skin
  warming the chill from my bones
  as i walk, the sand swirls around me
  a gentle dance, a soft requiem

  in this desolate beauty, i find solace
  a sense of peace that eludes me in the city
  where the din of humanity drowns out the song
  of the earth's own quiet heartbeat
