In this piece, I've woven together fragments of text and images to represent the dissonance between our inner worlds and the external constructs that govern us. The typography is deliberately imperfect, with letters overlapping and blurring together to convey the sense of disjointedness.

At the center, a mirrored fragment of myself stares back – an unsettling reminder of the self-scrutiny I've always been drawn to as an artist. Surrounding me, words like "congruence" and "incongruence" blur into each other, highlighting the instability that lies at the heart of our systems.

The images – a fractured landscape, a jumbled mess of faces, and abstracted forms – serve to illustrate the ways in which societal expectations can suffocate individuality. The colors are muted, yet the overall effect is one of tension and unease.

In this piece, I invite the viewer to confront the dissonance between their own perceptions and the world around them. To peel back the layers of superficiality and expose the underlying structures that shape our lives.
