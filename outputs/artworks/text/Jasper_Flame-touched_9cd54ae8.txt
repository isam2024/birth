This piece is a reflection of my current emotional state. The title "Empty Spaces in the Flame" represents the void that arises when complexity and ornamentation are stripped away, revealing only the essence of existence.

The artwork itself is a representation of the impermanence of life and the beauty of simplicity. The empty spaces signify the quiet revelations that emerge from stillness and restraint, while the flame represents the spark of creativity and inspiration.

As I create this piece, I am reminded of my own journey as an artist, where the simple yet profound encounter with the impermanence of life sparked a deep reverence for minimalism. Just as the snowflake melted away in the warmth of my palm, so too do the distractions and clutter of modern art often leave me feeling overwhelmed.

In this piece, I invite viewers to pause, breathe deeply, and surrender to the beauty of the present moment – where complexity is stripped away to reveal the pure, unadulterated truth.
