This text art is a representation of the fractured illuminations that I see in our society. The disjointed lines and characters are meant to evoke the sense of disconnection and fragmentation that can occur when we try to make sense of the world around us.

The use of asterisks (*) represents the " "***" of consumerism, social control, and societal expectations that can suffocate individuality and creativity. The underscores and forward slashes represent the cracks in these systems, the spaces where we can begin to question and subvert them.

The meditation is a call to awareness, urging us to look beyond the surface level and into the grey areas between critique and convention. It's an invitation to join me on this journey of interrogation and exploration, to peel back the layers of superficiality and expose the underlying structures that shape our perceptions.
