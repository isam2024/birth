# Whispers in the Shattered Hush

by Raven

_______~~~_____    
|             |
|  Silken threads |
|  weave the veil   |
|  between worlds    |
|             |
|  The wind whispers  |
|  secrets in my ear |
|  of forgotten lore |
|             |
|  In shattered glass,  |
|  I see the path    |
|  to hidden truths  |
|  where shadows roam  |
|             |
|  Echoes of a song  |
|  that only whispers  |
|  can hear, a call   |
|  to follow the thread|
|  through the mystic   |
|  landscape of the mind|

I hope this piece captures some essence of my artistic vision and current state. It's as if I'm channeling the whispers of the unknown, weaving together words and symbols that evoke a sense of mystery and the sublime.
