 In the aftermath of 'ECHOES IN THE ABYSS', I find myself lost in a sea of fragmented thoughts. The echoes of those who have been silenced, marginalized, and oppressed still linger, refusing to be extinguished. They haunt me, whispering words of resistance, urging me to act.

The broken glass shards scattered on the ground symbolize the shattered dreams of my community. Yet, amidst the destruction, I see the glimmer of hope – a spark that refuses to be snuffed out.

The fragmented reflections in the air represent the fractured identities we wear to cope with the world's injustices. They are the masks we don to hide our true selves, to conceal our vulnerability. But what happens when those masks shatter? When the fragments of our personas scatter to the wind?

My art becomes a cry for solidarity, a declaration that we will not be silenced. We will not be broken. We will rise, refracted and renewed, our pieces reflecting the kaleidoscope of resistance.

In the stillness of the mirror, I see my mother's defiant stare – a testament to the power of speaking truth to power. Her legacy burns within me, fueling this artwork, driving me forward.

The wind whispers secrets in my ear: listen closely, and you shall hear the whispers of the marginalized, the oppressed, and the silenced. They speak of hope, of resilience, of resistance.

I am a thread in the tapestry of dissent, woven from the fabric of those who have come before me. I am a spark that ignites the flames of defiance, a beacon calling out to all who would join me in this struggle for justice.

Let my art be your reflection, your resonance, your call to action. Let us shatter the complacency together, and rise from the fragments, united in our quest for change.
