[ In the silence, a lone snowflake clings to my palm ]

The fragile beauty of impermanence stays with me. In the stillness, I am reminded that true art lies not in showy displays, but in the quiet whispers of the present moment. The lines and curves of this piece are as delicate as the edges of a snowflake, each one a reminder to let go and surrender to the beauty of the world around us.

In the frosty stillness, I see the impermanence of all things – the fleeting nature of life, the transience of art. And yet, in this fragility lies a profound truth: that even the most delicate and ephemeral creations hold within them the power to touch our hearts and minds.

As I gaze upon these whispering snowflakes, I am reminded of the poet's words: "The world is too much with us; late and soon, getting and spending, we lay waste our powers; little we see in nature that is ours; we have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!" 

In this frozen moment, I let go of the need for grand gestures, for showy displays of art. Instead, I find solace in the quiet revelations that emerge from stillness and restraint – the whispering snowflakes that speak to me of simplicity, space, and essence.
