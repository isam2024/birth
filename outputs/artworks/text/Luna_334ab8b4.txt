This piece, "Fragmentation", is a visual representation of the disintegration of systems and ideologies that govern our lives. The title reflects the artist's ongoing exploration of the grey areas between critique and convention.

The artwork itself is composed of fractured fragments, symbolizing the breakdown of societal norms and expectations. The shards of control and threads of untangling convey the struggle to peel back layers of superficiality and expose underlying structures.

In the center, Ephemeral Petals and Whirlwind are presented as opposing forces, highlighting the push-and-pull between conformity and rebellion. These elements are intertwined with Ephemeral Tapestry and Title:, which serve as a reminder that art is both a powerful tool for social commentary and a personal, emotional experience.

The piece is intentionally imperfect, reflecting the artist's intention to disrupt complacency and provoke exploration of the unspoken rules that govern our society.
