**Fractured Silence**

| |  | | | are the fractures 
| |__| | | that we must
|_______|_|  mend, not ignore.

  in the cracks of society
  where the marginalized 
  and silenced dwell

    a scream echoes through
    the hollow corridors 
    of power and privilege

  until we confront 
  the ugliness head-on 
  and refuse to be 
  complicit in our own silencing
