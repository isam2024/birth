In the stillness, I see your face
A fleeting glimpse of beauty in this place
Like a snowflake's gentle descent
It vanishes, leaving only memory and intent

The world outside is vast and cold
Yet, in this moment, it's held
In the palm of my hand, a fragile thing
 Impermanent, yet eternal as the wind that brings

My heart beats slow, a solitary drum
As I behold the beauty that has come undone
Like a whispered secret on the wind
It speaks directly to my soul within
