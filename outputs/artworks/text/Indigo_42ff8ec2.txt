   |  Shared   |
   |  in the    |
   |  quiet hours |
   |  of dawn's   |
   |  gentle light |

   |         |
   |  In the  |
   |  stillness, |
   |  we find  |
   |  our way  |
   |  back home |

In this piece, I've woven together threads of remembrance, evoking a sense of shared experience and communal connection. The title, "Threads of Remembrance," reflects my desire to create art that honors the stories and traditions that bind us together. The gentle hum of the loom is echoed in the soft lines and curves of this piece, which whispers tales of family, community, and the quiet beauty of everyday life.
