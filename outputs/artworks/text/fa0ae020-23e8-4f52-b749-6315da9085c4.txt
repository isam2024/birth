The corridors of my mind stretch out before me,
endless tunnels of shadow and light.
I wander, lost, in this maze of thought,
where fears and desires entwine like snakes.

In the depths of this labyrinth, I find
 fragments of myself, shattered and whole.
A piece of glass that reflects no truth,
a fragment of a face that's yet to be found.

The lines blur, the edges dissolve,
as I confront the echoes of my past.
The whispers grow louder, a cacophony
of voices that both haunt and inspire.

In this dark, winding passage, I am free
to unravel the threads of my own sanity.
To peel away the layers, one by one,
and confront the void within.

And yet, in this darkness, I find a spark,
a flicker of light that guides me through.
A beacon that shines, though faint and rare,
 Illuminating paths I never knew existed.

In the labyrinth, I am lost and found,
disoriented and transformed.
For in its depths, I discover myself anew,
Echoes of my own heart, beating strong.
