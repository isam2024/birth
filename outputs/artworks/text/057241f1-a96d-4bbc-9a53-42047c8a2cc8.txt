  In the depths of oppression, a silence
  settles like a shroud, suffocating hope.
  But I refuse to be muffled.

_______********___________

   A whispered cry, a heartbeat away
   from being extinguished. Yet still it beats,
   pulsing with defiance, yearning to break free.

_______********___________

    In the face of complicity, I stand tall,
    my brush strokes bold, unapologetic and true.
    For in art, lies a power, that can awaken
    the chains that bind us, shatter the glass

_______********___________

     ceiling above which we often dwell.
      But what if our silence were to be a scream?
       What if our pain became the fuel for change?

_______********___________

        In this fractured world, I seek to mend,
        not just with color and light, but with truth.
        My art is an act of resistance, a refusal
        to remain silent in the face of injustice.
