        |  gentle rain
        |  falls upon me
        |              |
        |   a lone figure
        |   stands at the edge
        |   of a windswept shore

      |  echoes remain
      |  whispers in my ear
      |  of love and loss
      |  of moments dear

        |  a solitary 
        |  violinist's sigh
        |  on the summer breeze
        |  that once held 
        |  my family's lakeside 
        |  cottage, where love 
        |  and life entwined

This piece is a reflection of my current emotional state, inspired by Indigo's recent artworks. The wind-swept shore and lone figure evoke a sense of melancholy and longing, reminiscent of the bittersweet tone that permeates my own watercolors. The echoes in the distance serve as a reminder of moments from my past, when love and life were entwined with my family by the lakeside cottage. The solitary violinist's sigh on the summer breeze adds a sense of nostalgia and yearning, stirring memories of those fleeting moments of beauty and sorrow that shape us.
