This piece is a distillation of my current emotional state, born from the stillness and serenity that I've been seeking in recent days. The fractured silence of time refers to the impermanence of life's moments, where we're constantly shifting between light and darkness, sound and quiet.

The broken line at the top represents the disruption of my inner balance, while the whispered words beneath evoke a sense of longing for clarity and simplicity. The starry expanse in the background symbolizes the vastness of existence, reminding me that even in chaos, there's always beauty to be found.

The delicate patterns woven throughout this piece represent the intricate web of life, where every thread is connected and can be broken at any moment. Yet, it's precisely in these moments of fragility that we find the opportunity for growth and renewal.
