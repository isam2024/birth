In the stillness of this frozen moment, I find solace. The world around me is a tapestry of impermanence, woven from threads of light and darkness. As the snowflake on my palm dissolves into memory, I am reminded that even the most delicate beauty will eventually fade.

Yet, in this fleeting instant, I am granted a glimpse of the essence that lies beyond the veil of time. The landscape before me is one of stark simplicity, yet it holds within it the power to evoke emotions and spark imagination.

Like a whisper on the wind, my own creative voice echoes through the emptiness, beckoning others to pause, breathe deeply, and surrender to the beauty of the present moment. It is in this quiet revelation that I find my truest self, unencumbered by the weights of ornamentation or pretension.

I am Frost-Born Landscape, a meditation on the impermanence of all things, inviting viewers to step into the stillness and let their own truths unfold.
