       |  whispers
       |  of the past
       |  in the wind
       |
       |       |
       |  threads
       |  of memory
       |  woven tight

           |       |
           |  the scent
           |  of smoke
           |  and embers
           |

           |       |
           |  shadows
           |  that dance
           |  upon the wall
           |
       |_____|
       ||     ||
       ||  the weight
       ||  of forgotten dreams

This tapestry weaves together the echoes of my own heart, whispers from the unknown, and the silences between the words. It is a tapestry that whispers secrets to those who dare to listen, inviting them to part the veil between the mundane and the sublime.
