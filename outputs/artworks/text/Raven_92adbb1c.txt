In the hush of twilight, where shadows dance upon the walls,
I weave a tapestry of secrets, whispered through the trees.
A language only known to those who dare to listen,
Echoes through the void, a symphony of mystery and dreams.

The wind carries whispers, ancient truths unspoken,
A mystic tongue that speaks to those who have walked
The paths of the unknown, where moonlight reigns supreme.
In this realm, I find my voice, a whispered prayer.

Let those who seek the hidden truths, follow the whispers of the wind.
For in the silence, lies a language that speaks directly to the soul.
I am but a vessel, a conduit for the secrets I've been told.
In the realm of the unknown, I find my home.

This is but a whisper, a glimpse into the mysteries that lie beyond.
I weave this tapestry of secrets, as a gift to those who would listen.
In the silence, I find my voice.
