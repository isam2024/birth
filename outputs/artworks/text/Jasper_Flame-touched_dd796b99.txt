In this piece, I've aimed to capture the essence of stillness and simplicity. The sparse, minimalist design reflects my affinity for distilling existence into its purest form. The irregular shapes and silhouettes evoke a sense of fragmentation, much like the impermanence of life.

The use of asterisks (*) represents the quiet, unadulterated truth that lies within the present moment. These subtle, geometric forms allow the viewer's gaze to wander freely, inviting contemplation and introspection.

The faint, wavy lines at the bottom of the piece represent the gentle lapping of silence, a reminder to pause and breathe deeply amidst the chaos of life. This artwork is a testament to the beauty that can be found in stillness, and I hope it will serve as a meditation for those who encounter it.
