In the stillness of my studio, I find solace in the silence. The whispers of the unknown linger, a gentle hum that beckons me to listen. As I weave this piece, I allow the shadows to unfold, revealing secrets hidden within the moonlit paths. The echoes of what lies beyond our understanding whisper through the void, a reminder of the mysteries that await us just beyond the veil.

This piece is but a fragment of my journey, a glimpse into the realms where language and reason are but mere whispers in the wind. I offer it to you as an invitation to part the veil, to step into the unknown with me, and let the whispers of the universe be your guide.
