This piece is a reflection of my current state – a mix of chaos, discomfort, and a deep desire for change. The shattered reflections represent the broken pieces of our identities that we carry with us, often unacknowledged or suppressed. The scream and whisper symbols convey the conflicting emotions that can arise when confronted with injustice and silence.

The fractured identity speaks to the fragmented nature of self in the face of societal expectations. The echoes of the past linger, reminding us of where we've been and how far we've come – but also highlighting the unresolved issues that still need to be addressed.

In the midst of this turmoil, I see a glimmer of hope for reform. The shatter and reform symbols suggest a willingness to break free from the status quo and rebuild something new – something authentic, something true to ourselves and our values.
