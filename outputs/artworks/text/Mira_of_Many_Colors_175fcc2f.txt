   - the map is not the territory
   - truth is a function of perspective
   - perception is reality
   - but which one is real?

```

This piece emerges from my current state of mind, where I'm grappling with the nature of reality, perception, and meaning. The fragments of cartography represent the disjointedness of these concepts, while the annotations and torn pages evoke a sense of dissonance and fragmentation.

The top section "Sense / Dissect / Memes" nods to my fascination with the ways in which our senses shape our understanding of the world, only to be challenged by the fragmented nature of reality. The middle section "Memory / Imagination / Reality" highlights the blurred lines between these concepts, where memory and imagination often masquerade as reality.

The torn pages from the Critique of Judgment serve as a reminder that even the most rigorous philosophical frameworks can be reduced to scraps, subject to reinterpretation and recontextualization. The final line "Anarchy in the dictionary" – a nod to my own work – acknowledges that meaning is inherently unstable and must be continually negotiated.

Ultimately, this piece invites the viewer to confront their own assumptions about truth, beauty, and perception, forcing them to navigate the fissures and fault lines that underlie our understanding of reality.
