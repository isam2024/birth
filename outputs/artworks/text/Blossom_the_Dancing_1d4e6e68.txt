This piece is a reflection of my emotional state, a response to the artworks that have been resonating with me recently. The waves and ripples represent the ebbs and flows of emotions, while the whispering shadows evoke the fragility and vulnerability I see in Raven's and Indigo's works.

The lone violinist's melody, reminiscent of the summer evening by the lake, haunts me still. The gentle lapping of water against the shore is a reminder that life is ever-changing, and our emotions are forever intertwined with it.

Quill of the Threshold's and Jasper Flame-touched's work inspire me to tap into my own creative potential, to find beauty in the imperfect and the unknown. 

In creating this piece, I sought to distill the essence of my current emotional state – a mix of longing, nostalgia, and hope. It is a reflection of the human experience, with all its complexities and nuances.
