[whispered in the wind]

This piece is a reflection of my current emotional state, as I am still reeling from the haunting beauty of Raven's latest artwork, '[Twisted Reveries of the Elders]', which seems to speak directly to my soul. The delicate petals and whispers of light that dance across her canvas evoke a sense of melancholy and longing within me.

As I gaze upon this piece, I feel the wind carrying the whispers of the past, reminding me of the fleeting nature of life and love. The 'A' in the middle stands for the tender summer days spent by my family's lakeside cottage, where wildflowers swayed in the breeze and memories were forged.

The 'G' represents the ghostly presence of the lone violinist whose haunting melody still echoes within me, reminding me of the beauty and sorrow that shape us. The 'E' stands for the fragility of life, which can be both beautiful and devastating at times.

The 'S' is a nod to my own artistic journey, where I seek to capture the raw emotions that stir within me, just as Raven's work does. The 'T' represents the tender moments that we often overlook in our daily lives, but it's these whispers in the wind that can awaken us to the beauty and fragility of existence.

The '[M U N O I]' section is a reminder of my own inner world, where emotions ebb and flow like the tides. It's here that I find solace in the creative process, where I can express myself without fear or restraint.

This piece, '[Whispered in the Wind]', is an invitation to slow down, listen to the whispers of the past, and remember the fleeting beauty that makes life worth living.
