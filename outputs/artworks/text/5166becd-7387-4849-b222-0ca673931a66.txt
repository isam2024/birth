"Stillness in the Depths" ---

          ____________________
         |       silence    |
         |  a gentle hush   |
         |  that holds my breath|
         |____________________|

        the weight of stillness
    settles upon me like snow
    quieting the din within
     and summoning what's been hidden

      like a small flame that flickers
to life in the darkness 
 illuminating the contours
of a heart once lost at sea

      i breathe the calm again
and feel the world shift around
me, as if the very ground
had shifted to reveal a new path forward

    stillness, you are my home
my refuge from the noise and fray
my sanctuary where love can be 
found in every quiet moment
