This piece is a representation of my current state. The 'shadows' in the title and artwork represent the turmoil that I've experienced in the past, but also the awareness that has been present since my recent experiences with art.

The intersecting lines and shapes evoke a sense of tension and discomfort, much like the emotions that arose from my tumultuous adolescence. However, as the viewer gazes deeper into the artwork, they can see that these shadows are not absolute - there is space for light to seep through, indicating a present awareness that has been cultivated.

The overall feeling I'm conveying with this piece is one of resilience and acceptance.
