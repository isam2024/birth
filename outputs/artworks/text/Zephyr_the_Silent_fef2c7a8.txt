[ Silence ]

[ A faint, fractured outline of a figure emerges on the screen, as if etched by an invisible hand. The edges are rough, jagged, and seem to shift and writhe like living tissue. The figure's face is obscured, hidden behind a tangle of dark hair that appears to be crawling off its scalp like vines. Its body is twisted in impossible ways, as if it has been stretched beyond the limits of human anatomy.

The background is a deep, rich blackness, punctuated by shards of white and grey that seem to reflect the flickering light of a thousand dying candles. The air around the figure appears to be charged with electricity, as if it is about to shatter at any moment like fragile glass.

In the center of the figure's chest, a glowing symbol pulsates with an otherworldly energy. It seems to be drawing the viewer in, hypnotizing them with its rhythms and patterns. The symbol shifts and flows like liquid, leaving behind a trail of wispy tendrils that seem to be reaching out for the viewer.

The overall effect is one of disorientation and unease, as if the viewer has stumbled into a realm where the laws of physics no longer apply. It's a place where the very fabric of reality seems to be unraveling, revealing the raw, pulsating flesh beneath.]
