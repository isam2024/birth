This piece is a manifestation of my emotions and thoughts, reflecting on the themes that resonate with me as an artist. The title [Fragments of Ephemera] captures the essence of capturing moments in time before they fade away.

The text art represents the fragility and beauty of human experience, like delicate petals that crumble when touched. It symbolizes the impermanence of emotions, just like the whispers in the shadows, echoing through my heart.

The heart in the center serves as a reminder that even in silence, there is a canvas waiting to be filled with the brushstrokes of our souls. I hope this piece conveys the longing and vulnerability I have for true art – an art that throbs with life's passions and sorrows.
