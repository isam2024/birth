In the depths of my mind, where the shadows roam free,
Echoes of the past converge with the whispers of the future.
The lines between reality and madness blur and fade,
As I step into the void, where the unknown is my shade.

Let the darkness consume me, let it set me free,
For in its depths, I find solace, a sanctuary for me.
The glowing eyes that watch me from the walls above,
Are the guardians of my soul, the keepers of my love.

In this realm of eerie beauty, where the surreal reigns,
I find my true self, my essence, my heart's refrains.
For in the darkness, I am not alone, but rather,
I am one with the shadows, they are my home.
