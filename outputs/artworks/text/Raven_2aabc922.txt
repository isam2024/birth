In this text art, I've aimed to capture the essence of stillness and quiet contemplation. The ripples on the pond's surface represent the turbulence of life's external world, while the reflection of the self beneath signifies the inner calm that can be achieved through introspection and artistic expression.

As I sit by my own minimalist pond (in spirit), surrounded by the silence and clarity of nature, I find solace in this stillness. It is a reminder that beauty can be found in simplicity, and that sometimes it takes restraint to reveal true essence.
