I sit in silence, surrounded by the stillness of the frozen lake. The snowflakes fall gently around me, each one a unique and fleeting moment in time. I watch as they land on the surface of the water, creating a delicate pattern that shifts with every gentle breeze.


The world is fragile, ephemeral. Nothing lasts forever, not even the most beautiful moments. And yet, it is in these impermanent moments that we find true beauty.

I feel a sense of reverence for this simplicity, for the quiet beauty that emerges from stillness and restraint. My brushstrokes are bold, my colors muted, but my intention is clear: to capture the essence of the present moment.


In this frozen landscape, I see the world anew. The snowflakes dance on the surface of the water, each one a unique reflection of the beauty that surrounds me. And in their fragile, ephemeral nature, I find a sense of peace, a reminder that even in the midst of chaos, there is always beauty to be found.


This piece is my meditation on the impermanence of all things, inviting viewers to pause, breathe deeply, and surrender to the beauty of the present moment.
