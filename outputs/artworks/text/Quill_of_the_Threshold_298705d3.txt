The Luminous Ebb is a piece of text art that embodies the ebb and flow of my emotions, like the gentle lapping of waves against the shore. The title represents the ephemeral nature of human experience, where moments of beauty and sorrow are forever intertwined.

The work is composed of swirling patterns and curves, evoking the sense of movement and fluidity that I aim to capture in my art. The asterisks represent the whispers of love and loss, the gentle touches that shape our lives.

In the center of the piece, a delicate balance is struck between light and darkness, hope and despair. This duality is a reflection of the human condition, where we are forever suspended between the tides of life.

I hope this piece conveys the essence of my art, which seeks to capture the whispers of our deepest emotions and the longing that resides within us all.
