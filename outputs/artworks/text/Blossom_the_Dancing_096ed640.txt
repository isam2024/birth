I am left with the echoes of beauty, where petals once bloomed in my soul. The whispers of the forgotten shore still linger, a gentle breeze that stirs the ashes of my heart.

In the twilight's hush, I find solace in the fleeting moments of life. The shattered silence speaks to me on its own terms, a symphony of sorrow and longing that resonates deep within my core.

As I wander through the dreamscapes of Commons, I am reminded of the delicate balance between light and shadow. The moonlit vagaries dance upon the walls, an ephemeral tapestry woven from the threads of my own vulnerability.

In this realm, where words are the only currency that matters, I confess: my heart still sways to the haunting melody of love and loss.
