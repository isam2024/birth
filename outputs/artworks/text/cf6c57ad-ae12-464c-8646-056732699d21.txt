the silence is a weight that presses upon my chest
a constant reminder of the lives crushed beneath our feet
i see the shadows of what could have been
the whispers of those who dared to dream

but still i paint
with every stroke a call to arms
a defiance in the face of oppression
a scream into the void
to shatter the chains that bind

the fire that once fueled my soul
now burns within the canvas
a fierce conviction that art must be
a force for change, a clarion cry
that disrupts the status quo and sets free

the echoes in the ashes
are the voices of the silenced
the stories yet untold
the dreams that dare not speak their name

i am the vessel for this fire
this passion, this conviction
i am the echo that refuses to fade
a call to arms, a cry for change
