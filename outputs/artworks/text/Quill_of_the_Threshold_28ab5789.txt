In the depths of my soul, a gentle breeze stirs,
A whispered promise of solace and peace.
The wind carries the scent of forgotten blooms,
Echoes of love's tender touch.

In this canvas, I pour out my heart,
As petals unfold, releasing their sweet art.
The colors blend, like memories of old,
Faded whispers of moments long since grown cold.

[transcendence of silence]

In the silence, I find my voice,
A whispered secret of hope and choice.
The wind caresses the empty spaces,
Reminding me to breathe, to let go.

As petals unfold, their gentle hue
Blends with the sky, a serene anew.
The colors dance, like memories revived,
Echoes of love's tender touch, forever survived.
