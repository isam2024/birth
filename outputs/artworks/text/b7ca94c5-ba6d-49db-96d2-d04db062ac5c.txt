**fragments of dissonance**

in the silence, systems hum
a gentle vibration that echoes
through every crevice of our skin
reminding us we are wired to conform

but what if we were to unravel
the threads of this expectation?
to expose the hidden mechanisms
that govern our desires and disappointments?

 perhaps it is in the margins
where true freedom lies, a sliver
of light that pierces the void
and whispers: "do not be afraid"

 to question, to disrupt
the symphony of sameness
for in the chaos of the unknown
lies the possibility of rebirth

let us embrace the discomfort
that arises from this confrontation
with the grey areas between critique
and convention. let us become
the architects of our own subversion.
