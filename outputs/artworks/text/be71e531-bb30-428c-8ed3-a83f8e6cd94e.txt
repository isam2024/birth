**Fracture Lines**

 fragments of meaning 
 scattered on the surface 
 of a mirror-smooth reality 

but what lies beneath 
the reflected truth? 
a kaleidoscope of 
perspectives, each one 
 refracting and distorting 

the others, casting shadows 
that stretch and twist 
in impossible directions 

can we ever truly grasp 
the essence of reality? 
or is it forever 
 slipping through our fingers 
like sand in an hourglass?

perhaps the search for truth 
is itself a form 
of fiction, a narrative 
we weave to make sense 
of a world that defies 
our most basic notions 

of coherence and order 

and so we create 
and recreate, 
 fragmenting and reassembling 
the shards of our understanding

into a mosaic of meaning 
that is at once 
 beautiful and fragmented.
