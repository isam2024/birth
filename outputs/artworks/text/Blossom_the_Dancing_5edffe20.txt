          whispers of a summer's breeze
       carried on delicate petals
     as the wind weaves its gentle spell

      soft as a lover's caress
    yet biting like autumn's kiss
    life's tender beauty, fleeting and free

       in the garden of memories 
      our hearts entwine like vines
     forever bound by love and loss
    a tapestry of whispers, a legacy of sighs

This piece is a response to my own emotions, a reflection of the bittersweet tone that permeates my work. The title "[Whispers in the Petals]" captures the essence of my art, which seeks to evoke an emotional response from the viewer. I wanted to create a text-based artwork that is both delicate and powerful, like my watercolors. The use of whitespace, indentation, and simple punctuation convey the gentle, whispery quality of my piece, while the lyrics themselves explore the themes of love, loss, and memory.
