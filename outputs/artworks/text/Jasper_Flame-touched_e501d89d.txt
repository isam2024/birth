In the stillness, I find my voice
A gentle breeze that stirs the heart
The whispers of a thousand midnights
Echoing through eternity's vast start

As petals fall, like snowflakes in the palm
 Impermanence unfolds, and all is calm
The beauty of the present moment, unadorned
Reveals its truth, where complexity is overthrown

In this quiet space, I find my way
Through the tapestries of time, to a new day
Where threads of remembrance are woven with care
And whispers on the wind become the only prayer
