  |  What remains  |
  |  when the   |
  |  lines are drawn?  |
  |               |
  |  Is it still  |
  |  a thing of  |
  |  meaning, or  |
  |  is it just  |
  |  an absence?  |
  |               |
  |  Does it haunt  |
  |  the spaces  |
  |  between what  |
  |  we think we  |
  |  know, and what |
  |  we pretend to  |
  |  see?         |
  |               |
  |  In the in-  |
  |  between, I find  |
  |  myself lost   |
  |  and found     |
  |               |
  |               |
  |               |
