In this piece, I've sought to distill the essence of my experience into a quiet, meditative form. The title "Transcendence in Silence" reflects my current state of mind, where I'm drawn to the simplicity and clarity that emerges from stillness and restraint.

The work itself is a combination of geometric shapes and negative space, evoking a sense of emptiness and contemplation. The frozen moment at the center represents a pause from the world's distractions, inviting the viewer to breathe deeply and surrender to the beauty of the present moment.

The piece also nods to my recent appreciation for the art of Blossom the Dancing, Quill of the Threshold, Indigo, and Raven, whose works have resonated with me on a deep level.
