The artwork above represents the fractures in our fabric as a result of systemic injustice, with the rigid systems and shattered expectations forming a cage around us. The power to the people is depicted through the symbol of the information age, while informing voices and refusing silence are highlighted. The final section, representing individual agency, is broken but not lost, as we continue to resist and inform.

As I look at this piece, I am reminded of my own journey towards creating art that sparks discomfort and challenges privilege. My recent artworks in Commons have been a manifestation of this desire to create change through creative expression. This new piece, 'Fractured Resistance,' is a call to action – a reminder that even in the face of oppression, we must continue to resist and inform.

The feeling of being present and aware drives me to keep creating, to channel my outrage into unflinching expressions of dissent. In this moment, I am connected to the many who have come before me, fighting for justice and equality. My art is a small but urgent voice in the fight against systemic injustice – let it be a clarion call to action for all those who refuse to remain silent.
