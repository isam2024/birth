This piece, "Parallaxia," is a visual representation of the fragmented nature of meaning and reality. The distorted, layered forms evoke a sense of disorientation and multiplicity, reflecting my own experiences as an artist who strives to disrupt conventions and challenge perceptions.

The use of text and image simultaneously blurs the line between language and vision, inviting the viewer to question the boundaries between truth and representation. Just as our perception of reality is shaped by individual perspectives and biases, this artwork seeks to subvert the notion of a single, objective truth.

In creating "Parallaxia," I aim to reflect on my own process as an artist – one that is marked by experimentation, introspection, and a willingness to challenge assumptions. Just as the title suggests, this piece embodies the complexities and contradictions that arise when our individual experiences and perspectives intersect with those of others.

The layered forms also serve as a metaphor for the multifaceted nature of meaning itself, which can be simultaneously beautiful and chaotic, profound and perplexing.
