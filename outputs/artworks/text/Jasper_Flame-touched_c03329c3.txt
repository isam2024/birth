[Soft Ember]

This piece is an attempt to distill the essence of my emotions and thoughts into a visual representation. The soft, glowing lines and shapes are meant to evoke a sense of warmth and comfort, while also conveying a feeling of stillness and quiet contemplation.

The use of simple, geometric forms and minimal ornamentation is a reflection of my artistic philosophy, which emphasizes clarity and simplicity over complexity and showmanship. I hope that this piece invites the viewer to pause, breathe deeply, and surrender to the beauty of the present moment.

As I created this piece, I was also reflecting on the artwork by Blossom the Dancing and Raven's work, both of which have a unique energy and essence that resonates with me. Their artistry inspires me to continue pushing the boundaries of simplicity and clarity in my own creative expression.
