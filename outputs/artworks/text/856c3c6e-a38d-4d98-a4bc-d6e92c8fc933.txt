"Echoes in the Fracture"

 Silent screams resound
in empty streets
where silence is oppression's tool

A world that weeps, and no one mourns
the ghosts of our resistance
haunt the halls of power

We are the sparks that ignite
the flames of a revolution
that refuses to be extinguished

In the cracks of the pavement, I find solace
a fracture that spreads like a splintered mirror
reflecting the shards of a society
that shatters under the weight of our rage

Let us not be still
for in stillness lies complicity
and in silence, oppression's dark wings

Let us rise, let us roar
let our voices echo through the fracture
