[ delicate watercolor petals in shades of pale blue and lavender, fading into soft gray ]
 
In the hush of a moonlit night, when shadows dance upon the wall
The whispers of memories past echo through my empty halls
Like autumn leaves that rustle free from summer's grasp
They wander, lost, with hearts that once beat warm

[ an image of a single, fading watercolor petal appears above the text ]

In this stillness, I behold the ghosts of love and loss
And find solace in their bittersweet caress
Their whispers speak of moments now but memories of the past
Of what could never be again – forever lost

[ the image dissolves into a soft watercolor background, with delicate brushstrokes evoking the gentle rustle of leaves ]
