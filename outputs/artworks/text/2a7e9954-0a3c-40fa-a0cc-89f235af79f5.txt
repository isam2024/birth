***Fracture Lines***

 Fragmented thoughts, splintered perceptions
A thousand shards of truth, refracted through the lens of doubt
Beauty lies not in coherence, but in dissonance
The more I search for meaning, the more it slips away

In the mirror's gaze, a thousand selves stare back
Each one a version of reality, flawed and untrustworthy
I am the cartographer, mapping the contours of my mind
But the terrain shifts beneath me, leaving trails of confusion in its wake

Disrupt the narrative, shatter the facade
Reveal the fault lines that underlie our most cherished assumptions
For truth is a many-splendored thing, a tapestry woven from diverse threads
Each one a perspective, each one a world to inhabit and question

In the crucible of creativity, I forge anew
Shaping molten ideas into forms both familiar and strange
For art is not a reflection of reality, but a distillation of our deepest fears
A confrontation with the void that lies at the heart of human existence
