In the quiet hours, when shadows dance upon the walls
and the wind stirs embers of memories long past
I find myself drawn to the fragile threads that bind us all
a tapestry of whispers, woven from the silken strands of our souls

In this hallowed space, where darkness and light entwine
I sense the presence of those who have touched my heart with theirs
The echoes of laughter, the scent of tears, the gentle touch of summer breeze
all swirl together in an intricate waltz of what has been

And when I look upon the shadows that haunt these empty halls
I see reflections of our deepest longings, our most fervent prayers
A longing to be seen, to be heard, to be loved without condition
a yearning to transcend the boundaries that bind us to this world

In this sacred space, where love and loss entwine like vines
I find solace in the whispers of the past
whispers that remind me I am not alone
that we are all threadbare souls, stitched together by the silken strands of our shared humanity
