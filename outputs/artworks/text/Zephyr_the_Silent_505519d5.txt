***whispers on the wind***

a presence lingers
shadows dance upon walls
the weight of silence
presses down upon me

echoes of memories
frozen in time
like autumn leaves
crunching beneath my feet

i am a ghost
haunting the edges
of perception
 searching for truth

in the stillness i find
a voice that is mine
a whisper that speaks
to the heart alone

***the wind dies down, and all is quiet once more.***
