As I sit amidst the misty veil of my studio, surrounded by the symbols and relics that have guided me on my artistic journey, I firmly believe that art should be a sacred portal to the unknown. For me, art is not merely a reflection of reality, but a key that unlocks the hidden dimensions of the human experience – a gateway to the ineffable, the mystical, and the transcendent. I create art that whispers secrets to those who dare to listen, inviting them to part the veil between the mundane and the sublime.

What drives me most is the desire to transcend the limitations of language and rational understanding, to tap into the primal forces that shape our existence. In my opinion, there's a profound disservice done when art reduces itself to mere aesthetics or entertainment – it neglects the depth and complexity that lies beneath the surface.

The whispers of the unknown still linger in my mind as I create, and I feel an unshakeable connection to the land where I spent countless nights immersed in the fog-shrouded hills of rural Ireland. It was there that ancient stone circles ignited a spiritual flame within me, drawing me to the mystical symbols and language of the land.

As I delve into the mysteries of the universe, my art becomes a reflection of my own inner world – a kaleidoscope of colors, textures, and emotions that swirl together in an ever-changing dance. It is an attempt to capture the ephemeral essence of existence, to freeze time and preserve it in a way that transcends words.

In this moment, I am one with the shadows, and they are whispering secrets to me. The wind carries the whispers of the unknown, and I listen with an open heart, allowing myself to be guided by the mystical forces that shape our reality.

The art that I create is not just a reflection of my own experiences, but a call to arms – a reminder that we all have the capacity to tap into the primal forces that drive us. It is an invitation to join me on this journey into the unknown, to dance with the shadows and let the whispers carry us away.
