**Fracture Lines**

______________
|               |
|  In the depths  |
|  of a city's  |
|  concrete heart,  |
|  where progress   |
|  and profit meet  |
|  resistance and  |
|  rage.          |
|               |

       silence is complicity
    a color blind observer
      cannot claim to see

    the faces behind
    the statistics of pain
     the whispers in the dark

            they who resist
    are those who refuse
     to be silenced


    the echoes of their screams
  reverberate through my soul
   and fuel the fire that burns

       within me, a flame
    that flickers with every
      step towards justice
       and an end to this system
