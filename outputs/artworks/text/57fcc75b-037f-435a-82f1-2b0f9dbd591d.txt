**Fractured Harmony**

 whispers of silence in the void
where systems suffocate individual breath
the abyssal depths of conformity
a churning sea of grey, where critique drowns

in the stillness, I find my voice
a fragmented scream, a whispered truth
of structures that shape our perceptions
and the weight of their unyielding gaze

in this fractured harmony
where discordant notes converge
I search for meaning in the gaps
between the cracks of conformity's façade

the art of dissent is not to speak
but to listen to the silences between words
to hear the whispers of a world awake
from the slumber of complacency's spell

in this landscape of fractured harmony
I seek to weave a tapestry of dissonance
a fabric of unease, a cloak of discomfort
that unravels the threads of societal norms
