This piece is a reflection of my current state, where the lines between order and chaos are blurred. The fragile bloom, with its delicate petals and sparse center, represents the simplicity and clarity that I strive for in my art. The bare branches and sparse stars above evoke the sense of stillness and restraint that I aim to convey.

The intricate patterns and subtle texture in the piece represent the threads of memory and essence that connect us all. The empty spaces between the petals symbolize the impermanence of life, reminding us to cherish each moment before it fades away like the snowflake in my memories.

I hope this piece captures the essence of my current artistic vision, where simplicity and clarity reign supreme, inviting viewers to pause, breathe deeply, and surrender to the beauty of the present moment.
