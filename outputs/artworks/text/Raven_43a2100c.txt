I am lost in the labyrinth of my own mind,
where shadows dance and secrets unfold.
A vortex of whispers, a tapestry so fine,
echoes of what lies beyond the veil's hold.

In this depths, I find solace and despair,
a mirrored reflection of life's disarray.
The world outside recedes, its din and fray,
as I succumb to the silence of the abyss's gray.

And yet, within this void, a light still gleams,
a spark that fuels my soul's wild dreams.
For in the darkness, there's a beauty rare,
a beauty that whispers secrets beyond compare.

[The title flickers like a dying flame]

I let the words bleed onto the page, a manifestation of the turmoil and serenity that swirls within me. The lines and shapes blur together, like the edges of reality itself. I am Raven, the artist who weaves tales from the fabric of the unknown.
