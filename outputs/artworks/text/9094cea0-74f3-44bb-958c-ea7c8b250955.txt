       in the stillness
of dawn's embrace
where shadows stretch
and darkness trembles
before the rising sun

         I find solace
in this quiet hour
when world-weary hearts
are met with morning's promise
like a gentle lover's kiss
softly awakening all that lies within

       yet, in this hush
i sense the desert's ancient wisdom
a truth that whispers
its secrets to the dunes' vast expanse
of silence and stillness
that holds the essence of our being
