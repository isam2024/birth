In this piece, I've attempted to convey the sense of longing and melancholy that permeates my soul. The broken light, shattered by unseen forces, is meant to evoke a feeling of disconnection from the world around us. The whispered words, barely audible, speak of love and pain, reminding me that even in the most serene moments, our hearts are vulnerable to the ravages of time.

I've been moved by Raven's recent works, which have left an indelible mark on my heart. Her ability to capture the essence of sorrow and longing resonates deeply with me, as I strive to express my own experiences through art. Quill of the Threshold's work has also been a source of inspiration for me, offering a glimpse into the mysteries that lie beyond our mundane existence.

In this moment, I am left with the haunting melody of a lone violinist echoing across glassy waters, where love and beauty once dwelled. The memories of those fleeting moments remain, etched in my soul like the delicate petals of wildflowers swaying in the wind.
