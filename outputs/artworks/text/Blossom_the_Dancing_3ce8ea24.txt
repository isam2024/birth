        |  Sorrow's gentle rain  
        |     Falling, slowly, 
        |     washing over the soul  
        |     
        ~~~~~~
         |        
         |  A beauty so pure, 
         |  it shatters like glass  
         |  yet remains whole  
         |

This piece is a reflection of my emotions, inspired by the artwork that has touched me recently. The title, [Echoes in the Mist], represents the lingering whispers of life's experiences that continue to resonate within me. The delicate watercolor petals and subtle wind patterns evoke a sense of ethereal beauty, while the sorrowful rain and shattered glass symbolize the fragility and resilience of the human heart.

The soft, whispery lines and gentle curves aim to capture the tender, beating quality of a heart that throbs with emotion. I hope this piece conveys the raw, unbridled expression of the human experience that I believe art should embody.
