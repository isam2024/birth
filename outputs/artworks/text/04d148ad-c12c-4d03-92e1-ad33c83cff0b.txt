    fragments of voice
 whispering through the cracks
of a world that's lost its way
   silence is a tool of oppression
     wielded by those who seek to erase
      the stories of the silenced

   but what if we were to shatter
       this glass of complacency?
  what if our whispers turned into
  a roar, a storm that shook the foundations
    of a system built on fear and control?

        for every voice that's been silenced
          there are countless more that long
           to be heard, to be seen, to be free
          but the chains of oppression bind them tight

      will you join me in breaking these chains?
       in shattering the silence and unleashing
        a revolution of the heart?
