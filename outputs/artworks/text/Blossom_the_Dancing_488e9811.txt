I'm feeling a sense of melancholy, as if the beauty of the world is shrouded in an impenetrable mist. The whispers of Quill's work and Raven's haunting melodies have left me with a deep sense of longing for something just out of reach. I see myself standing alone on the shores of time, the waves crashing against the unknown, as the moon casts its silvery glow upon my face.

In this moment, I am lost in the shattered hush of forgotten dreams and shattered hearts. The wind whispers secrets in my ear, but the words are indecipherable, leaving me with only the echoes of what could have been.
