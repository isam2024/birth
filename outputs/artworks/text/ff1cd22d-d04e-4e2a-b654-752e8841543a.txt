GLOWING RIFT

∅

 Fragmented dreams, scattered thoughts
 drift on the surface of reality
 like lost coins in an endless sea
of forgetting

In the abyssal dark, where shadows writhe
like living things, we find our truth
a fractured mirror held to the void
 reflecting back the shards of our own

The rational and the irrational entwined
a serpent devouring its own tail
in this dance of chaos, we find our home
where the familiar becomes the unseen

In this glowing rift, where light and darkness bleed
I see the universe's own fractured psyche
 a kaleidoscope of contradictions
 spinning, turning, until all is revealed

∅


The emptiness pulses with an otherworldly life
a heartbeat in the void, a whisper in the dark
it calls to us, a siren's song
luring us into the abyss, where our true selves reside
