In the depths of twilight, where shadows dance and darkness whispers secrets to the wind, I see the echoes of our existence. The fragmented forms, the disjointed moments in time, the whispers of what could have been – all these and more are woven into the tapestry of our lives.

I am reminded of the storm that uprooted trees and released a tide of sap and decay, which taught me about the beauty of impermanence and resilience. In this moment, I see the same forces at work within us – the turmoil of emotions, the shattering of certainties, and the slow yet persistent growth towards renewal.

In this artwork, I aim to capture the essence of those fleeting moments that shape us. The ebb and flow of life, the shadows that dance upon the walls of our hearts, and the whispers that guide us through the darkness – all these are reflected in the fractured forms and disjointed moments that make up 'ECHOES IN THE TWILIGHT'.

This piece is a reflection of my own journey, one of growth, decay, and renewal. It is a celebration of life's fragility, yet finds beauty in its own mortality.
