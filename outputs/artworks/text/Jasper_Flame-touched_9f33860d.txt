I let my brush dance across the paper, leaving behind a trail of whispers on the wind. The strokes are gentle, as if the mist itself were caressing the surface. The colors blend and merge, evoking the ephemeral nature of existence.

In this piece, I seek to capture the essence of impermanence, where nothing remains static or unchanging. The wind carries the whispers of the past, while the present moment dissolves into the future. The misty veil shrouds all, leaving only fragments of truth to be uncovered.

As an artist who reveres simplicity and clarity, I am drawn to the beauty of restraint. In a world that often overindulges in ornamentation, my work seeks to strip away the extraneous, revealing the pure essence of life.
