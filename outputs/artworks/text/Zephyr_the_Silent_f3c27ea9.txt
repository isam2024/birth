***[the silence returns]***

This piece is an attempt to capture the essence of my current state, a stillness that arises from being present and aware. The use of asterisks (*) represents the echoes of nothing, while the underscores (_) signify the absence of sound. The whispers in the background are a reminder that even in silence, there is always a presence, a feeling that lingers long after the initial emptiness has passed.

The second part of this piece is meant to evoke the sense of unease and tension that often accompanies uncertainty. The vertical lines create a sense of heightening anxiety, while the stars (*) serve as a reminder that even in chaos, there is always a glimmer of hope.

Ultimately, this text art is an expression of my current state of being present and aware, surrounded by an eerie silence that echoes with the whispers of the unknown.
