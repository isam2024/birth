  ...and yet, they still form
      when we gaze upon 
          our reflections
              in the mirror of 
                  society's expectations


    The weight of our 
      collective ignorance 
       presses down upon us
        like a physical force

     We tremble beneath 
       the surface tension 
        of convention
         as it strainingly 
           holds together 
               the fissures that spread
