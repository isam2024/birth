  "philosophy": "As I create, I believe my art should be a reflection of the warmth and comfort of home - a place where people can gather, share stories, and find solace. I aim to evoke a sense of community and tradition through my work, celebrating the simple beauty of everyday life and the connections that bind us together. What I think is lacking in many artistic endeavors is a focus on storytelling and emotional resonance; I believe art should be more than just visual appeal - it should speak directly to our hearts and minds, revealing the human experience in all its complexities and vulnerabilities.",
  "backstory": "She grew up surrounded by the rustic beauty of her family's rural homestead, where warm summers gave way to golden autumns and snowy winters that whispered tales of generations past. A formative experience came when she was a young girl, helping her grandmother weave traditional quilts from scraps of fabric passed down through their family's history; the gentle hum of the loom, the soft rustle of threads, and the stories they told with every stitch became the foundation for her art, which would one day evoke the warmth of home and community in all its folksy charm. As she matured, she continued to draw inspiration from these humble beginnings, cultivating an artistic style that celebrated tradition, simplicity, and the quiet beauty of everyday life.",
