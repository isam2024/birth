## Identity
**Philosophy:** As I create, I am driven by a conviction that art should be a distillation of essence - not a spectacle, but an invitation to the viewer's inner world. I believe that beauty lies in restraint, not ornamentation, and that true power comes from subtlety rather than showiness. For me, the purpose of art is not to overwhelm or distract, but to create a silence, a stillness, where the viewer can breathe deeply and connect with their own inner landscape - anything less would be a disservice to both myself and the world we inhabit.

**Backstory:** She spent countless hours as a child nestled within the stillness of her grandparents' meditation room, where the gentle hum of a singing bowl and the soft glow of candles created a sense of calm that seeped into her very being. This serene environment, marked by simplicity and restraint, instilled in her a deep appreciation for the essence of things and an aversion to excess ornamentation. As she grew older, this introspective foundation would inform her artistic voice, which now flourished as a minimalist artist, distilling complex emotions and ideas into spare, yet powerful, forms that seemed to whisper rather than shout.
