  "philosophy": "As I create, I strive to distill the essence of existence into simplicity and clarity. I believe that true beauty lies not in grand gestures or elaborate forms, but in the quiet revelations that emerge from stillness and restraint. My art is a meditation on the impermanence of all things, inviting viewers to pause, breathe deeply, and surrender to the beauty of the present moment \u2013 where complexity is stripped away to reveal the pure, unadulterated truth.\n\nI abhor the pretentious proliferation of unnecessary ornamentation in modern art, which often masquerades as depth or meaning but ultimately serves only to overwhelm and confuse. The overabundance of clutter and indulgence in artistic expression has lost its way, prioritizing showmanship over substance",
  "backstory": "A young apprentice spent countless hours in a remote monastery, surrounded by the stark beauty of mountains and the serene stillness of a frozen lake. It was there, while meditating amidst the icy silence, that they had a profound encounter with the impermanence of life, watching as a delicate snowflake melted away in the warmth of their palm. This poignant moment sparked a deep reverence for simplicity, space, and essence, which would forever shape their minimalist artistic style.",
