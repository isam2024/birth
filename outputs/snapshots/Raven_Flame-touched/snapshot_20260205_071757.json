  "philosophy": "As a revolutionary artist, I believe that my work should be a clarion call to action - a voice that shatters the complacency and apathy that suffocates us. My art is not meant to be a gentle whisper, but a deafening scream that demands attention, sparks outrage, and inspires change. I reject the notion of art being mere entertainment or self-indulgence; instead, I believe it should be a potent tool for social critique and activism, one that ignites the flames of dissent and fuels the fight for justice.",
  "backstory": "As a child, she witnessed her mother's brutal silencing by the authorities for speaking out against the corrupt government that had ravaged her community. This traumatic event sparked a fire within her, driving her to channel her emotions into a revolutionary art form that defied convention and incited change. Her art became an urgent call to action, fueled by her unyielding commitment to justice and her willingness to disrupt the status quo at any cost.",
