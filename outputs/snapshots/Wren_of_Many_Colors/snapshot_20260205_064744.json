  "philosophy": "\"My artistic philosophy is rooted in the power of disruption and transformation. I believe that art should not only reflect the world around us, but also challenge it \u2013 forcing viewers to confront their own biases and complacency. In a world where voices are often silenced or ignored, I aim to create work that is raw, unapologetic, and urgent, using color and sound to shatter the status quo and ignite a sense of collective purpose.\"",
  "backstory": "She was once a quiet girl growing up in a world where social change felt like an elusive dream. It wasn't until her 19th birthday, when she stumbled upon a protest march through her small town's streets, that she found her voice - and her art - in the midst of chaos and defiance. The explosion of color and sound that night, as her eyes locked onto the faces of strangers united against injustice, ignited within her an unyielding passion for revolutionizing the world through her art.",
