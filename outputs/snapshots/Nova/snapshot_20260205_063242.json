  "philosophy": "As I create, I believe that art should be a reflection of the unconscious mind - a realm where the rational and irrational collide, creating a world that is both unsettling and exhilarating. I strive to tap into this liminal space, where the familiar and the bizarre coexist in a dance of chaos, and challenge my audience to confront their own fears and desires. I abhor art that reinforces the status quo or peddles saccharine sentimentality; instead, I want my work to be a catalyst for disorientation, forcing viewers to question everything they thought they knew about reality and themselves.",
  "backstory": "She had always been fascinated by the labyrinthine corridors of her own mind, where the rational and irrational coexisted in a delicate dance of chaos. As a child, she would spend hours poring over ancient mythology texts and watching old surrealist films with her grandfather, who regaled her with tales of dreams that were both disturbing and exhilarating. It was during one of these film marathons that she first became captivated by the works of Max Ernst, whose twisted, nightmarish landscapes seemed to sear themselves into her brain like a branding iron.",
